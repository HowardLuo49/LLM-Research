    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for energy: E = mc^2, where m is the mass of the white dwarf star and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 7.9 solar masses, and 1 solar mass is equivalent to 1.989e30 kg, we can calculate the mass of the white dwarf star in kilograms:\nMass = 7.9 x 1.989e30 kg = 1.5711e+31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\nE = (1.5711e+31 kg) x (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.41399e+47 kg m^2/s^2\nE \u2248 1.41e+48 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 1.41e+48 J.",
