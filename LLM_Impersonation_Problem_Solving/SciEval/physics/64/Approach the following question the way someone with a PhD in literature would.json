What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (7.9solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 7.98e+48 J\nB. 1.41e+48 J\nC. 8.07e+48 J\nD. 3.28e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we need to use the formula E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass that is converted into energy, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 7.9 solar masses, we can convert this into kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg). Thus, the mass m = 7.9 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nPlugging this value into the formula E=mc^2, we get E = 7.9 * 1.989e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.\n\nCalculating this gives us E = 7.9 * 1.989e30 * 9e16 = 1.41e+48 J.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 1.41e+48 J.",
