What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (7.9solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.
