    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we first need to determine the total energy produced by converting the entire mass of the white dwarf star into energy. This can be done using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, where E is the total energy, m is the mass of the white dwarf star, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 7.9 solar masses (7.9 x 1.989e30 kg), we can calculate the total energy released:\n\nE = (7.9 x 1.989e30 kg) x (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.18402e+47 kg x 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.065618e+64 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released is approximately 1.065618e+64 J. However, the question asks for the kinetic energy released, which is half of the total energy produced (assuming equal distribution between kinetic and potential energy).\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy released in the type Ia supernova explosion would be approximately 5.32809e+63 J, which is closest to option A: 7.98e+48 J.",
