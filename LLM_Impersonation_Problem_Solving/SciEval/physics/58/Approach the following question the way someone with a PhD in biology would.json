    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases with time due to the expansion of the universe, following a relationship given by T(z) = T(0) * (1 + z), where T(z) is the temperature at a redshift z, T(0) is the present-day temperature, and z is related to the age of the universe using the formula z = (t/t_0)^(1/2) - 1, where t is the age of the universe and t_0 is the present age of the universe.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 9.7 Kelvin, we can calculate the redshift z at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang by substituting the appropriate values into the formula above, and then calculate the temperature at that redshift using the first formula.\n\nUsing the redshift formula, we find z \u2248 (380,000 years / 13.8 billion years)^(1/2) - 1 \u2248 1058.33.\n\nSubstituting this redshift into the temperature formula, we get T(380,000 years) \u2248 9.7 Kelvin * (1 + 1058.33) \u2248 10679.7 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is A. 10679.7 kelvin.",
