    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases as the universe expands and cools down. The relationship between the temperature of the radiation at present time (T_0) and at a time t after the Big Bang is given by:\n\nT(t) = T_0 * (1 + z)\n\nwhere z is the redshift factor. The redshift factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = a_0 / a(t)\n\nwhere a_0 is the scale factor at present time (1) and a(t) is the scale factor at time t. The scale factor a(t) is related to the age of the universe t by:\n\na(t) = a_0 * (t/t_0)^(2/3)\n\nSubstituting these equations into the original expression, we find:\n\nT(t) = T_0 * (a_0 / a(t))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT(380,000 years) = 9.7 K * (1 / (1 * (380,000 / 13.8x10^9)^(2/3)))\n\nT(380,000 years) = 9202.4 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 9202.4 kelvin.",
