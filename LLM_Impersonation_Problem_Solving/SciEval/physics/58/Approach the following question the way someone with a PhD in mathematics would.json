    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the relationship between the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the age of the universe. From the current temperature of the CMB radiation being approximately 9.7 Kelvin, we can use the formula T = T_0 * (1 + z) to calculate the temperature at a certain age after the Big Bang.\n\nAssuming a standard cosmological model and data, we can calculate the redshift z at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This can be done using the relationship between redshift and the age of the universe in a matter-dominated universe. \n\nUsing the redshift calculated from the previous step, we can then calculate the temperature of the universe at the given age. \n\nUnfortunately, without the specific redshift value or exact parameters, it is not possible to provide an exact numerical answer. However, based on the choices provided, option C (5734.1 Kelvin) seems like the closest approximation to the correct answer.",
