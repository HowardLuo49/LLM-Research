Calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses, a radius of 40 kilometers, and an accretion rate of 0.5 solar masses per year. Assume the disk is made of gas that is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium and has a temperature of 10 million Kelvin. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.
