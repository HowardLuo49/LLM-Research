Calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses, a radius of 40 kilometers, and an accretion rate of 0.5 solar masses per year. Assume the disk is made of gas that is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium and has a temperature of 10 million Kelvin. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

The mass-to-light conversion factor \u1d25 depends on the composition of the disk, which is given as 10% hydrogen and 90% helium. We also need to determine the disk velocity v, which can be approximated as the escape velocity from the disk:\n\nv = sqrt(2GM / R)\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation above to calculate the luminosity. Then, to find the total energy released, we need to multiply the luminosity by the time interval over which the accretion disk is active.\n\nAfter performing all the necessary calculations, the correct option closest to the total energy released should be:\n\nC. 1.02e+39 J",
