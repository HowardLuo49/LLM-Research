    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977685 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was completely ionized, so the black body radiation at that time had a black body spectrum. The peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation corresponds to a temperature of about 2.73 K (T0). \n\nUsing the formula above, we can calculate the peak wavelength of the CMB radiation at 2.73 K:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T0\n\u03bb_max = 2.8977685 x 10^-3 m K / 2.73 K\n\u03bb_max \u2248 1.062 x 10^-3 m\n\nNow, we need to find the temperature at which the universe was completely ionized, assuming it had the same peak wavelength of the CMB radiation at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Using the same formula:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT \u2248 2.8977685 x 10^-3 m K / (1.062 x 10^-3 m)\nT \u2248 2.732 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.732 K. This is closest to option C: 3000.0 K.",
