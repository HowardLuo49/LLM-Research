    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = c / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum and a temperature of T0 = 2.73 K, we can use the above formula to solve for the peak wavelength \u03bb_max at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Since the universe was completely ionized at that time, we can assume that the radiation reaches thermal equilibrium and follows a black body spectrum.\n\nNext, we can calculate the temperature T at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using Wien's displacement law, where T is the temperature at that time and \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength at that time.\n\nWe can then compare the calculated temperature to the given options to select the closest answer.\n\nUsing the calculated temperature, we find that the closest option is:\n\nC. 3000.0 K",
