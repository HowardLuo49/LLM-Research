    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is given as:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength and T is the temperature. \n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum and the temperature today (T0) is 2.73 K, we can use the following relation to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\nT0 / \u03bb0 = Ti / \u03bbi\n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, we can consider the peak wavelength to be the size of the observable universe at that time. The size of the observable universe at that time would be the comoving distance light could travel from the beginning of the universe to 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This distance can be calculated using the speed of light, Hubble's constant, and the scale factor of the universe.\n\nSolving for Ti, we get:\n\nTi = T0 * \u03bb0 / \u03bbi = 2.73 * 380,000 / \u03bbi\n\nGiven that \u03bbi would be smaller than \u03bb0, the temperature Ti would be higher than T0. \n\nOption A: 9330.31 K\nOption B: 4225.68 K\nOption C: 3000.0 K\nOption D: 4710.79 K\n\nBased on the calculations above, the closest option would be C. 3000.0 K.",
