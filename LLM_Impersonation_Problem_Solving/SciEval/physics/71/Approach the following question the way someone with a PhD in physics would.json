    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for total energy (E = mc^2) where m is the mass difference between the initial mass and the remnant mass.\n\nGiven:\nInitial mass (M1) = 33 solar masses = 33 * 1.989e30 kg\nRemnant mass (M2) = 1.5 solar masses = 1.5 * 1.989e30 kg\nVelocity (v) = 10,000 km/s = 10,000,000 m/s (since 1 km = 1000 m)\nSpeed of light (c) = 3e8 m/s\n\nMass difference, \u0394m = M1 - M2 = (33 * 1.989e30 kg) - (1.5 * 1.989e30 kg)\n\nNow, using the equation E = \u0394m * c^2, we can calculate the total energy released:\nE = (\u0394m) * (c^2) = [(33 * 1.989e30 kg) - (1.5 * 1.989e30 kg)] * (3e8 m/s)^2\n\nCalculating this gives us the total energy released in joules.\n\nComparing the calculated value with the given options, the closest one is:\n\nA. 7.05e+48 J\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A. 7.05e+48 J.",
