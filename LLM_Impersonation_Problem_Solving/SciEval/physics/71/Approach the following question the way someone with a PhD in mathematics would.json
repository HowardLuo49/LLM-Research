What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.5 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 33 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 7.05e+48 J\nB. 5.64e+48 J\nC. 4.01e+48 J\nD. 7.6e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation E = 0.5 * m * v^2, where E is the total energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity. \n\nFirst, we convert the masses from solar masses to kilograms: \nInitial mass = 33 solar masses = 33 * 1.989e30 kg = 6.56e+31 kg\nRemnant mass = 1.5 solar masses = 1.5 * 1.989e30 kg = 2.9835e+30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the total energy released using the given velocity: \nE = 0.5 * (6.56e+31 kg - 2.9835e+30 kg) * (10,000,000 m/s)^2\nE = 0.5 * 3.26165e+31 kg * 1e14 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.630875e+31 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nA. 7.05e+48 J",
