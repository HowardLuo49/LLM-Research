    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation curve is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is \u03bb_max * T = 2.898 * 10^-3 m*K, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength in meters and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 177.8 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (3 * 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency in Hz. Plugging in the values, we get \u03bb = (3 * 10^8) / (177.8 * 10^9) = 1.687 * 10^-3 m.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula for Wien's displacement law to solve for the temperature:\n\nT = (2.898 * 10^-3) / \u03bb_max = (2.898 * 10^-3) / (1.687 * 10^-3) = 1.715 K.\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.72 K. Option C is the closest to the correct answer.",
