    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum to its temperature. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.89777 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 177.8 GHz (1 GHz = 10^9 Hz), we can convert this frequency to wavelength in meters using the formula \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). We have:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (177.8 GHz) = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (177.8 x 10^9 Hz) = 1.68 mm\n\nNow, we have the peak wavelength \u03bb_peak = 1.68 mm. Substituting this into Wien's Law and solving for T:\n\n1.68 x 10^-3 m = (2.89777 x 10^-3 m K) / T\nT = 2.89777 / 1.68 = 1.72 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.72 K. The closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 1.72 K",
