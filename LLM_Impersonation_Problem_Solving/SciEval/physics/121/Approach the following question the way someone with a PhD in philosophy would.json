    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 177.8 GHz (or 177.8 x 10^9 Hz), we can convert this to the corresponding wavelength using the equation c = f\u03bb, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). Rearranging for wavelength, we have:\n\n\u03bb_max = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (177.8 x 10^9 Hz) = 1.68 mm\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature T:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max = (2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 m*K) / (1.68 x 10^-3 m) \u2248 1726 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1726 K.\n\nFrom the given choices, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.72 k",
