    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that \u03bb_max * T = constant, where \u03bb_max is the wavelength at which the radiation peaks and T is the temperature. \n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 177.8 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the relationship c = \u03bb * f, where c is the speed of light. Therefore, \u03bb = c / f = 3 x 10^8 m/s / (177.8 x 10^9 Hz) = 1.686 mm.\n\nUsing the value of the peak wavelength, we can calculate the temperature as T = constant / \u03bb_max = 2.898 x 10^-3 m * K / 1.686 x 10^-3 m = 1.72 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.72 K.",
