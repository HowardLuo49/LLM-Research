    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.8977729 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 177.8 GHz, we can use the relationship between frequency and wavelength for electromagnetic waves:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nSubstitute the given frequency into the formula to calculate the wavelength at the peak:\n\n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 m/s / (177.8 x 10^9 Hz) = 1.685 mm\n\nNow we can use the peak wavelength to calculate the temperature using Wien's displacement law:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak = (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K) / (1.685 x 10^-3 m) \u2248 1.72 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is C. 1.72 K.",
