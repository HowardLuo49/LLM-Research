What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (2.1solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.97e+48 J\nB. 8.15e+48 J\nC. 7.08e+48 J\nD. 3.76e+47 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for energy equivalence E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.1 solar masses, we can calculate the mass in kg by multiplying 2.1 by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg). This gives us a mass of approximately 4.1879e30 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released by using the formula E=mc^2. Plugging in the values for mass and the speed of light (3e8 m/s), we get:\n\nE = 4.1879e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.1879e30 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 37.6905e46 kg m^2/s^2\nE = 3.76905e47 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer closest to the calculated value is option D: 3.76905e47 J.",
