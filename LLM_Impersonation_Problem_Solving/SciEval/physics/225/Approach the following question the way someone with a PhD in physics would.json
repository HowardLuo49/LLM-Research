    "gpt_response": "To find the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop carrying a current, we can use the Biot-Savart Law which states that the magnetic field at a point due to a current-carrying element is directly proportional to the current flowing through the element, the length of the element, the sine of the angle between the element and the line connecting the element to the point, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the element and the point.\n\nFor a circular loop of radius 1 cm carrying a current of 1 A, we can consider the loop as being made up of infinitesimally small current-carrying elements. At the center of the loop, these elements will contribute to the magnetic field in the same direction.\n\nThe formula for the magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is given by:\n\nB = (\u03bc0 * I * R^2) / (2 * (R^2)) \n\nB = (\u03bc0 * I) / (2)\n\nPlugging in the values for the constants, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m) * 1 A) / 2\nB = 6.3 * 10^(-7) Tesla\n\nThe closest option is C. 6.28 x 10^(-5) Tesla.",
