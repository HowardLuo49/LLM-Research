    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the magnetic field in a galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the formula for calculating the magnetic field strength in a rotating disk galaxy:\n\nB = (0.2 * V * R) / (2 * pi)\n\nWhere:\nB is the magnetic field strength\nV is the rotational velocity of the galaxy (337 km/s)\nR is the radius of the galaxy (50,000 light-years)\n\nConverting the rotational velocity to m/s:\n337 km/s = 337,000 m/s\n\nPlugging in the values:\nB = (0.2 * 337,000 * 50,000) / (2 * pi)\nB = (6,740,000 * 50,000) / (2 * 3.14159)\nB = 337,000,000,000 / 6.28318\nB = 53,586,094.87 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster with a radius of 50,000 light-years and a rotational velocity of 337 km/s is approximately 53,586,094.87 T.\n\nComparing this to a similar non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field strength in the non-rotating galaxy would be considerably lower as rotational motion plays a significant role in generating magnetic fields in galaxies. Additionally, the non-rotating galaxy would also lack the contribution of a dynamo action generated by the motion of gas and stars in a rotating disk galaxy. \n\nGiven the calculated value, option C (5835 T) is the closest to the correct answer in this case.",
