The magnetic field in a galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster can be calculated using the formula for the magnetic field strength in a rotating disk, taking into account the radius and rotational velocity of the galaxy.\n\nThe magnetic field in a galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster with a radius of 50,000 light-years and a rotational velocity of 337 km/s can be estimated using the formula:\n\nB = sqrt((\u03c0 * G * \u03a3 * R^2) / V)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, G is the gravitational constant, \u03a3 is the surface density of the galaxy, R is the radius of the galaxy, and V is the rotational velocity of the galaxy.\n\nGiven the values provided, we can calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy and compare it to the magnetic field in a similar non-rotating galaxy. The magnetic field in a rotating galaxy is expected to be stronger compared to a non-rotating galaxy due to the additional contribution from the rotation of the galaxy.\n\nBased on my calculations, the closest option to the correct answer would be:\n\nC. 5835 T",
