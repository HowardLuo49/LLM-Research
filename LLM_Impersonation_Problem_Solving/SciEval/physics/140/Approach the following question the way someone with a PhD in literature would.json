Given that the filament is 442 megaparsecs (Mpc) in length and has an average thickness of 10 kiloparsecs (kpc), the volume of the filament can be calculated as follows:\n\nVolume = length x width x height\nVolume = 442 Mpc x 10 kpc x 10 kpc\nVolume = 442 x 10^3 kpc x 10^3 kpc\nVolume = 442 x 10^6 kpc^2\n\nNext, we need to convert the volume from kiloparsecs to cubic centimeters. 1 kpc is equal to 3.086 x 10^21 cm, so:\n\nVolume = 442 x 10^6 kpc^2 x (3.086 x 10^21 cm)^2\nVolume = 442 x (3.086)^2 x 10^42 cm^3\nVolume = 4419.45 x 10^42 cm^3\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass density of the filament. Given that the gas in the filament is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, we can calculate the mass density of the atoms in the filament. Knowing the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.008 g/mole and helium is 4.0026 g/mole, and their respective percentages:\n\nAverage atomic mass = 0.75 x 1.008 + 0.25 x 4.0026\nAverage atomic mass = 3.0093 g/mole\n\nNow, calculate the mass density:\n\nMass density = Number density x Average atomic mass\nNumber density = Mass density / Average atomic mass\n\nLet's calculate the number density of atoms in the filament assuming it is in thermal equilibrium by using the given choices:\n\nA. 8.95e-06 atoms/cm^3\nB. 5.1e-06 atoms/cm^3\nC. 4.02e-06 atoms/cm^3\nD. 4.82e-06 atoms/cm^3\n\nAfter the calculations, the closest choice is B. 5.1e-06 atoms/cm^3.",
