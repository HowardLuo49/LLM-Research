    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula for period of rotation:\n\nT = 2 * \u03c0 * R / V\n\nwhere T is the period of rotation, R is the radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo (79540 light-years = 7.547e20 meters), \u03c0 is 3.14, and V is the rotational velocity of the galaxy.\n\nGiven that the velocity of light (c) is 3e8 m/s and 1 light year is 9.461e15 meters, the velocity of the galaxy can be calculated as V = c * light year = 3e8 * 9.461e15 = 2.8383e24 meters/year.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 7.547e20 / 2.8383e24 = 1.325e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is A. 1.35e+08 years.",
