    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0r / v\n\nwhere T is the rotational period, r is the average radius of the galactic halo (79540 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year), and v is the velocity of light (3e8 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 79540 * 9.461e15 / 3e8\nT = 6.28 * 79540 * 9.461e15 / 3e8\nT = 6.28 * 7.52e17 / 3e8\nT = 47.2896e17 / 3e8\nT = 1574741.1667 seconds\n\nTo convert this into years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year:\n\nT = 1574741.1667 / (60*60*24*365.25)\nT \u2248 49.9e10 / (3.154e7)\nT \u2248 1.583e3 years\n\nTherefore, the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo is approximately 1.583 thousand years, which is closest to option A: 1.35e+08 years.",
