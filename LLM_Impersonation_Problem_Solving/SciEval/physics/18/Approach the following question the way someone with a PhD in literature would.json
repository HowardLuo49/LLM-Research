What is the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, given its average radius of 79540 light-years? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 1.35e+08 years\nB. 8.34e+08 years\nC. 6.81e+08 years\nD. 7.33e+08 years\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = (2 * \u03c0 * R) / V\n\nWhere:\nT = rotational period\nR = radius of the halo in meters (79540 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year)\nV = velocity of light in meters per second (3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst, convert the radius of the halo from light-years to meters:\n79540 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 7.527e20 meters\n\nNow, plug the values into the formula:\nT = (2 * 3.14 * 7.527e20) / 3e8\nT = 4.72e13 seconds\n\nFinally, convert the result to years:\nT = 4.72e13 seconds / (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year) = 1.5e+06 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option is A. 1.35e+08 years.",
