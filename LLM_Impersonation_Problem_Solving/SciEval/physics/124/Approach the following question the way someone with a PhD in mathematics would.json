    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = (b / T)\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977685 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 394.7 GHz, we can calculate the corresponding wavelength using the formula:\n\nc = \u03bb * f\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency.\n\nBy solving for the wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (394.7 x 10^9 Hz) = 7.59 x 10^-4 m or 759 nm\n\nNow we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max = (2.8977685 x 10^-3 m*K) / (759 x 10^-9 m) = 3.82 K (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is:\n\nB. 3.81 K",
