    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation assuming it to be a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody.\n\nThe peak wavelength (\u03bb_max) is related to the peak frequency (f_max) by the equation c = \u03bb_max * f_max, where c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 394.7 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the equation f = c / \u03bb, where c is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (394.7 x 10^9 Hz) = 7.6 x 10^-4 meters or 760 \u00b5m.\n\nNow that we have the peak wavelength, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that \u03bb_max * T = b, where b is a constant approximately equal to 2.9 mm * K.\n\nTherefore, T = b / \u03bb_max = (2.9 mm * K) / 760 \u00b5m = 3.81 K.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is B. 3.81 K.",
