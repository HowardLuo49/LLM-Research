    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a blackbody, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nThe wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency can be calculated using the formula: \u03bb_peak = c / \u03bd_peak, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and \u03bd_peak is the peak frequency (394.7 GHz = 394.7 x 10^9 Hz).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\u03bb_peak = 3 x 10^8 m/s / 394.7 x 10^9 Hz = 7.6 x 10^-4 m = 760 \u03bcm\n\nNow, to find the temperature, we can use Wien's displacement law:\nT = b / \u03bb_peak, where b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 mK).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 mK / 760 x 10^-6 m = 3.81 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 3.81 K.",
