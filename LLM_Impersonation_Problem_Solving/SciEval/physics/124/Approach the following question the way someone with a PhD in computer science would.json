    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula relating temperature (T) and peak wavelength (\u03bb_peak) is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = 2.898 x 10^6 nm * K\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 394.7 GHz, we can use the formula:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f\n\nWhere c is the speed of light and f is the frequency in Hz. Converting the frequency to Hz, we get:\n\n394.7 GHz = 394.7 x 10^9 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the peak wavelength:\n\n\u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (394.7 x 10^9 Hz)\n\n\u03bb_peak \u2248 0.76 mm\n\nSubstitute this value into Wien's displacement law formula and solve for temperature:\n\n0.76 mm * T = 2.898 x 10^6 nm * K\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^6) / (0.76 x 10^-6) K\nT \u2248 3810 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3.81 k",
