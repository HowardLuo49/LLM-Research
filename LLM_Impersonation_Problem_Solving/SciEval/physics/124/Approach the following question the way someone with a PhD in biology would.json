The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2898 \u03bcm * K) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency, 394.7 GHz (which is 0.3947 mm), and T is the temperature of the blackbody radiation. \n\nRearranging the formula, we can solve for T:\n\nT = (2898 \u03bcm * K) / \u03bb_max\nT = (2898 \u03bcm * K) / 0.3947 mm\nT = 7333.53 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7333.53 K. \n\nNow, let's determine the corresponding wavelength of the peak frequency.
