    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes, we can use the following formula:\n\nh = (4G^(5/3))/(3c^4)(\u03c0^(2/3))(M\u03c7M\u03c6(f^(2/3)/r)\n\nWhere:\nh = amplitude of gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant\nc = velocity of light\n\u03c0 = pi\nM\u03c7 = mass of one black hole (73 solar masses)\nM\u03c6 = mass of the other black hole (39 solar masses)\nf = frequency of gravitational waves\nr = distance to the gravitational wave source (1 billion light-years)\n\nFirst, let's convert the masses of the black holes from solar masses to kilograms:\nM\u03c7 = 73 solar masses = 73 x 1.989e30 kg = 1.45257e32 kg\nM\u03c6 = 39 solar masses = 39 x 1.989e30 kg = 7.75251e31 kg\n\nNext, we need to calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves. The frequency can be approximated as twice the orbital frequency of the black holes just before coalescence. For equal-mass black holes in a circular orbit just before coalescence, the frequency is approximately 220 Hz (this is just a rough estimate, not an exact calculation).\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the formula:\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11^(5/3))/(3 * 3e8^4)(\u03c0^(2/3))((1.45257e32 * 7.75251e31)((220)^(2/3)) / (1 billion light-years * 9.461e15 m))\n\nh = 9.5625373e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected amplitude of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 73 and 39 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth is approximately 9.56e-21.\n\nNext, to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector, we can use the formula:\n\nS/N = (h^2 * f)/\u221a(S_h(f))\n\nWhere:\nS/N = signal-to-noise ratio\nh = amplitude of gravitational waves\nf = frequency of gravitational waves\nS_h(f) = noise power spectral density of the detector\n\nGiven that the expected amplitude h is approximately 9.56e-21 and we estimated the frequency f to be around 220 Hz, and based on LIGO's sensitivity, let's assume the noise power spectral density S_h(f) is around 4e-47 Hz^(-1/2).\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\nS/N = ((9.56e-21)^2 * 220)/(\u221a(4e-47))\n\nS/N = 4.04716e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector is approximately 4.05e-21.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 4.05e-21",
