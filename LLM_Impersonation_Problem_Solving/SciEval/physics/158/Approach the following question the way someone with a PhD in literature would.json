    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 73 and 39 solar masses located 1 billion light-years away, we can use the formula for the amplitude of gravitational waves:\n\nAmplitude = (4 / c^2) * [(G / (3 * \\pi)) * (M1 * M2) / R] * (v^2 / c^2) * (1 / (2 * \\pi * f))^2\n\nWhere:\n- M1 = mass of the first black hole = 73 solar masses = 73 * 1.989e30 kg\n- M2 = mass of the second black hole = 39 solar masses = 39 * 1.989e30 kg\n- R = distance from Earth = 1 billion light-years = 1e9 * 9.461e15 m\n- v = velocity of the binary system = (G * (M1 + M2) / R)^(1/3)\n- f = orbital frequency of the binary system = v / (2 * \\pi)\n- c = velocity of light\n- G = gravitational constant\n- \\pi = 3.14\n\nBy substituting the given values into the formula, we can calculate the expected amplitude. Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be calculated by dividing the amplitude of the signal by the noise level of the LIGO detector. The expected SNR value can then be compared to the given choices to find the closest one.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the closest option would be:\n\nC. 9.65e-21",
