    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the following formula:\n\nProbability = e^(-A*N*X)\n\nWhere:\nA = Absorption area = 0.1 m^2\nN = Number of atomic nuclei per unit volume of the human body = ~ 3.3 x 10^28 atoms/m^3\nX = Effective thickness of the body = 1.8m (approximated average thickness of a human body)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nProbability = e^(-(0.1)*(3.3e28)*(1.8)) = e^(-5.94) = 0.0026\n\nThis means that there is a 0.26% probability of the cosmic ray passing through the human body.\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body, we can use the following formula:\n\nDose = Energy of cosmic ray * Probability * Absorption coefficient\n\nGiven that the energy of the cosmic ray is 3e+18 eV and the absorption coefficient for a human body is approximately 1.6 * 10^-7 Gy/eV, we can calculate the dose:\n\nDose = (3e+18) * 0.0026 * (1.6 * 10^-7) = 5.07e-13 Gy \n\nTherefore, the closest option is D. 5.07e-13 Gy.",
