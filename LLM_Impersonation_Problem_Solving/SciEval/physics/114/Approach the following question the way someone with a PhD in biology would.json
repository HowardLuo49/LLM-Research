    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the probability of interaction between the cosmic ray and the atoms in the body. This probability can be estimated using the mean free path of the cosmic ray in the body. The mean free path can be calculated using the cross-section of interaction between the cosmic ray and the atoms in the body.\n\nGiven that the energy of the cosmic ray is 3 e+18 eV, we can convert this to joules: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. Therefore, the energy of the cosmic ray is 4.806 x 10^-1 J.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the mean free path of the cosmic ray based on the cross-section of interaction. This requires knowledge of the cross-section, which is typically around 10^-24 m^2 for high-energy cosmic rays interacting with atoms.\n\nProbability of interaction = cross-section * absorption area = 10^-24 m^2 * 0.1 m^2 = 10^-25\n\nTherefore, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body is 1 - 10^-25 = 1.\n\nTo estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we can use the absorbed dose formula: Dose = Energy / Mass.\n\nThe mass of a typical human body is around 70 kg. Therefore, the absorbed dose is 4.806 x 10^-1 J / 70 kg = 6.8657 x 10^-3 Gy.\n\nOf the given choices, the closest answer is:\n\nB. 3.20e-13 Gy.",
