    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3e+18 eV passing through a human body, we will first need to calculate the interaction cross-section. The interaction cross-section for cosmic rays with energies above 1 TeV is approximately 10^-30 m^2.\n\nUsing the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, we can determine the probability of interaction as P = A * interaction cross-section.\nP = 0.1 m^2 * 10^-30 m^2 = 10^-31\n\nNow we can calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray. The dose D (in Gray, Gy) is given by D = energy transferred / mass. The energy transferred can be estimated as the energy of the cosmic ray, which is 3e+18 eV converted to Joules using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.\n\nEnergy of cosmic ray = 3e+18 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 4.806e-01 J\n\nSince we assume all the energy is deposited in the body, the dose is then calculated as D = energy transferred / mass = 4.806e-01 J / 70 kg (typical human body mass) = 6.8657e-03 Gy.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 4.68e-13 Gy.",
