    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the expression for the cosmic ray interaction cross section, which is approximately given by \u03c3 \u2248 3 x 10^-28 m^2.\n\nThe probability of interaction (P) can then be calculated as P = \u03c3A, where A is the absorption area given as 0.1 m^2. Therefore, P = (3 x 10^-28 m^2)(0.1 m^2) = 3 x 10^-29.\n\nThe dose of ionizing radiation received by the body can be calculated as the energy (E) of the cosmic ray multiplied by the absorption probability, multiplied by the radiation dose in Gray (Gy) per unit energy. The radiation dose for cosmic rays is typically estimated to be around 0.1 Gy per eV. Therefore, the dose can be calculated as D = (3 x 10^18 eV)(3 x 10^-29)(0.1 Gy/eV) = 9 x 10^-11 Gy.\n\nTherefore, the calculated dose is closest to option A: 4.68e-13 Gy.",
