    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the interaction cross-section of the cosmic ray with the human body. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP = \u03c3 * n * d\n\nWhere:\nP = Probability of interaction\n\u03c3 = Interaction cross-section\nn = Number density of target particles\nd = Thickness of the target\n\nGiven that the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2 and assuming a typical human body thickness of around 0.1 m, we can calculate the number density of target particles using Avogadro's number and the density of the human body. The interaction cross-section will depend on the energy of the cosmic ray.\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose which is given by the formula:\n\nD = E * \u03a6 * \u03b7\n\nWhere:\nD = Absorbed dose\nE = Energy deposited by the ionizing radiation in the body\n\u03a6 = Energy fluence of the ionizing radiation\n\u03b7 = Mass energy absorption coefficient of human tissue\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray, we can calculate the energy deposited in the body. The energy fluence can be calculated based on the probability of interaction calculated earlier.
