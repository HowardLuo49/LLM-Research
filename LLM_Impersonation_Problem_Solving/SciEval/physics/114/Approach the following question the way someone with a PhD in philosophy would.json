    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the cross-section of interaction between the cosmic ray and the body. Given the energy of the cosmic ray, we can estimate the cross-section using theoretical models and experimental data. Let's assume the cross-section to be on the order of 10^-30 m^2.\n\nNext, we can calculate the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body by multiplying the absorption area A (0.1 m^2) by the cross-section. Therefore, the probability P is approximately 0.1 * 10^-30 = 1e-31.\n\nNow, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose in gray (Gy). The absorbed dose is given by the energy of the cosmic ray (3e+18 eV) multiplied by the probability of interaction and divided by the mass of the body.\n\nUsing the values provided, we can calculate the absorbed dose as follows:\nD = (3e+18 eV) * (1e-31) / mass of body\n\nNow, without information about the mass of the body, we cannot provide an exact numerical value for the absorbed dose.
