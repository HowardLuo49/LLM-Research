    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial mass (m1) = 114 solar masses = 114 * 1.989e30 kg = 2.26346e32 kg\n- Final mass (m2) = 9 solar masses = 9 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.7901e31 kg\n- Velocity (v) = 10,000 km/s = 10,000 * 1000 m/s = 1e7 m/s\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the change in mass (\u0394m) = m1 - m2:\n\u0394m = 2.26346e32 kg - 1.7901e31 kg = 2.08456e32 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy released during the supernova explosion:\nKE = (1/2) * \u0394m * v^2\nKE = (1/2) * 2.08456e32 kg * (1e7 m/s)^2\nKE = 1.04228e32 kg * 1e14 m^2/s^2\nKE = 1.04228e46 J\n\nHowever, this is not the total energy released in the supernova explosion. A significant portion of the initial mass is converted into energy, as per Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2. The total energy released will be much larger than the calculated kinetic energy.\n\nTo find the total energy released, we need to calculate the energy equivalent of the change in mass using E=mc^2:\nE = \u0394m * c^2\nE = 2.08456e32 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 2.08456e32 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.876104e49 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the supernova explosion is approximately 1.88e+49 J, which is closest to option D.",
