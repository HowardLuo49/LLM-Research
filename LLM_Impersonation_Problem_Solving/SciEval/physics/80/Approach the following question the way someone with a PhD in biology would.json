What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 9.0 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 114 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * mv^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and v is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses given into kilograms:\n\nInitial mass = 114 solar masses = 114 * 1.989e30 kg = 2.26746e32 kg\nRemnant mass = 9 solar masses = 9 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.7901e31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy released in the explosion:\n\nKE = 0.5 * (1.7901e31 kg) * (10000 km/s)^2\nKE = 0.5 * 1.7901e31 kg * (10000 * 1000 m/s)^2\nKE = 0.5 * 1.7901e31 kg * 1e8 m^2/s^2\nKE = 8.9505e38 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice to the calculated total energy released in the supernova explosion is D. 1.88e+49 J.",
