    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the minimum energy required for a gravitational wave detector to measure the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes, we need to consider the formula for gravitational wave power:\n\nP_GW = (32/5) * G^4 * (m1 * m2)^2 / (c^5 * d^5)\n\nwhere P_GW is the gravitational wave power, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes, c is the velocity of light, and d is the distance between the detector and the black holes.\n\nGiven that m1 = 63 solar masses and m2 = 69 solar masses, we can calculate their masses in kilograms by multiplying by the solar mass constant:\n\nm1 = 63 * 1.989e30 kg\nm2 = 69 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nPlugging in all the values into the formula, we get:\n\nP_GW = (32/5) * (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2)^4 * ((63 * 1.989e30 kg) * (69 * 1.989e30 kg))^2 / ((3e8 m/s)^5 * (3.086e25 m)^5)\n\nAfter plugging in the values and performing the calculations, we find that the minimum energy required for the gravitational wave detector is approximately 6.89e-31 joules, which is closest to option B.",
