    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the magnetic field in a galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk given by the dynamo theory, which states:\n\nB = sqrt(4*pi*rho*k*v), where B is the magnetic field, rho is the mass density of the disk, k is the dynamo coefficient, and v is the rotational velocity of the galaxy.\n\nGiven that the galaxy in question has a radius of 50,000 light-years and a rotational velocity of 262 km/s, we can calculate the magnetic field using the formula above. However, without knowing the specific values of rho and k, we cannot provide a precise numerical value for the magnetic field.\n\nIn general, the magnetic field in a rotating galaxy is expected to be stronger compared to a non-rotating galaxy due to the dynamo effect generated by the rotation of the disk. The magnetic field in the rotating galaxy helps to sustain the rotational motion and can influence the dynamics and evolution of the galaxy.\n\nTherefore, without specific values for rho and k, the correct option from the given choices cannot be determined.",
