    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the equation for the magnetic field in a rotating disc galaxy, which is given by:\n\nB = v * sqrt(3) / (2 * pi * R)\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field strength\nv = rotational velocity of the galaxy in m/s (262 km/s = 262,000 m/s)\nR = radius of the galaxy (50,000 light-years = 4.73 x 10^20 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = 262,000 * sqrt(3) / (2 * pi * 4.73 x 10^20)\nB = 7377 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field strength in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is approximately 7377 Tesla.\n\nHow does the magnetic field in this rotating galaxy differ from that in a similar non-rotating galaxy? In a non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field strength would be zero as there is no rotational motion to generate a magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy is much stronger compared to a non-rotating galaxy.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB) 7377 T",
