    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 7e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the interaction of the cosmic ray with the body. The probability of a cosmic ray interacting with matter is given by the interaction cross-section.\n\nThe interaction cross-section is typically on the order of 10^-28 m^2 for high-energy cosmic rays. Given that the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, we can calculate the cross-section for the human body as:\n\ninteraction cross-section = A / N \u2248 0.1 m^2 / 10 m^-28 m^2 \u2248 1e27\n\nUsing this cross-section, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the human body is approximately 1 / 1e27 = 1e-27.\n\nNext, we can estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray. The absorbed dose is given by the energy deposited by the cosmic ray in the body, divided by the mass of the body. Given the energy of the cosmic ray is 7e+18 eV = 1.12e-10 J, and assuming the body mass is on the order of 70 kg, we can calculate the absorbed dose as:\n\nabsorbed dose = energy / mass \u2248 1.12e-10 J / 70 kg \u2248 1.6e-12 Gy\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 9.92e-13 Gy",
