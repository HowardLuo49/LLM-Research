    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius represents the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. In the context of black holes, the Schwarzschild radius is the radius at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape, leading to the formation of an event horizon.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses, we use the formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * G * mass / c^2\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 7 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 7 * 1.989e30 / 9e16\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 188622492e-11 / 9e16\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 188622492 / 9e27\n\nSchwarzschild radius \u2248 20958 m\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 20649 m",
