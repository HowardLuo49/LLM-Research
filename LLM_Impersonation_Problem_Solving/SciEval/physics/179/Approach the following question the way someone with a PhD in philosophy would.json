Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 94419 m\nB. 88623 m\nC. 20649 m\nD. 56528 m\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild. It represents the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, which means that within this radius, no light or information can escape from the gravitational pull of the black hole.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius (Rs) is calculated using the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 7 solar masses, we first convert this to kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the Sun (1.989e30 kg). Therefore, M = 7 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula, we get:\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 7 * 1.989e30 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\n\nCalculating this, we get Rs \u2248 20649 meters.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nC. 20649 m.",
