What is the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 12568 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of the star, we can use Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In this case, the semi-major axis is the distance of the star from the center of the Milky Way, which is 12568 light years.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from light years to meters:\n12568 light years * 9.461e15 meters/light year = 1.18874e+20 meters\n\nNext, we can calculate the orbital period using Kepler's third law:\nPeriod^2 = (4 * pi^2 * semi-major axis^3) / (G * (mass of Milky Way))\n\nMass of Milky Way is estimated to be around 1.5e12 solar masses * mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg)\n\nNow, we can substitute the values and calculate the orbital period:\nPeriod^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 * (1.18874e+20)^3) / (6.674e-11 * 1.5e12 * 1.989e30)\n\nSolving for Period, we get:\nPeriod = 9.26e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is C. 9.26e+08 years.",
