What is the minimum energy required for a gravitational wave detector to measure the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes with masses 80 and 38 solar masses, respectively? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;f_GW = 100 ;the distance d=3.086e25 m.
