What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (2.5solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 4.48e+47 J\nB. 9.68e+48 J\nC. 5.19e+48 J\nD. 5.8e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula E = mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass being converted, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.5 solar masses, we can calculate the mass in kilograms:\nMass = 2.5 * (1.989e30 kg)\nMass = 4.9725e30 kg\n\nNow, we can use the formula to calculate the energy released:\nE = 4.9725e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.47225e61 kg m^2/s^2\n\nConverting this energy to joules:\n1 J = 1 kg m^2/s^2\nE = 4.47225e61 J\n\nThis value is closest to option B, which is 9.68e+48 J.",
