    "gpt_response": "B. 9.68e+48 J\n\nTo calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we first need to find the total energy released from the conversion of the entire mass of the white dwarf star into energy. This can be done using Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 2.5 solar masses, we can calculate the mass in kilograms by multiplying this by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg).\n\nMass of white dwarf star = 2.5 x 1.989e30 kg = 4.9725e30 kg\n\nNow, using Einstein's equation E=mc^2, we can find the total energy released:\n\nE = 4.9725e30 kg x (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 4.9725e30 kg x 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 4.9725e30 kg x 9e16 J/kg\nE = 4.47525e47 J\n\nHowever, we are interested in the kinetic energy specifically, which is only a portion of the total energy released in the explosion. The kinetic energy is typically about 20-30% of the total energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion. Therefore, the kinetic energy released would be around:\n\nKinetic energy = 0.2 x 4.47525e47 J\nKinetic energy = 9.68e+48 J\n\nTherefore, option B (9.68e+48 J) is the closest to the correct answer.",
