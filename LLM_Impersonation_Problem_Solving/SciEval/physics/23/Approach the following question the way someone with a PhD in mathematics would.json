    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the distance that a star must be from a black hole of 9 solar masses in order to orbit the black hole with a period of 1 day, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. \n\nLet T be the orbital period (1 day = 86400 seconds). The mass of the black hole is 9 times the mass of the Sun (9 * 1.989e30 kg).
