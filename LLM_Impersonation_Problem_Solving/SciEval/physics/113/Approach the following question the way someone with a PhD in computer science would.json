    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 3e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we first need to determine the interaction cross-section of the human body with the cosmic ray. The interaction cross-section depends on the atomic number and density of the material, as well as the energy of the cosmic ray.\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray is 3e+18 eV, we can convert this to joules using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. Therefore, the energy of the cosmic ray is 4.80654e-1 J.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interaction cross-section of the human body with this energy cosmic ray. This can be a complex calculation involving theoretical models and empirical data.\n\nAssuming we have the interaction cross-section, we can then calculate the probability of interaction based on the formula:\n\nProbability = cross-section * thickness / A\n\nWhere thickness is the average thickness of a human body, which we can estimate to be around 0.15 m.\n\nNow, for estimating the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to the cosmic ray, we can use the formula:\n\nDose = energy absorbed / mass\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray and assuming the mass of a human body is around 70 kg, we can calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received.\n\nWithout the specific values for the interaction cross-section and other parameters, it is challenging to provide an exact answer. However, based on the choices provided, the closest answer seems to be option B: 7.53e-13 Gy.",
