    "gpt_response": "To calculate the event horizon radius of a black hole, we can use the formula: \n\nR = 2GM / c^2,\n\nwhere R is the event horizon radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 4 solar masses, which is equivalent to 7.956e30 kg (4 * 1.989e30 kg), and the values of G and c are provided, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nR = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 7.956e30 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\nR = 12696.64 / 9e16\nR = 1.41e-11 m \n\nSo, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 4 solar masses is approximately 141 picometers. Therefore, the closest option is A. 11800 m.",
