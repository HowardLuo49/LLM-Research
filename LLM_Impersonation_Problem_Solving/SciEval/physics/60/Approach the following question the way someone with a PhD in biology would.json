    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of temperature with the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the temperature at a certain age after the Big Bang is given by the equation:\n\nT = To / (1 + z)\n\nWhere T is the temperature at the given age, To is the present-day temperature (7.8 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor, which can be calculated as z = 1 / (age in years + 1).\n\nFor an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\nz = 1 / (380000 + 1) = 1 / 380001\nT = 7.8 / (1 + 1 / 380001) = 7.79999473632 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option is:\nC. 7305.2 kelvin",
