Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, named after Karl Schwarzschild, is the radius of the event horizon surrounding a non-rotating black hole, beyond which nothing can escape its gravitational pull, not even light. It is related to black holes as it defines the boundary within which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses, we use the formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * G * mass / c^2\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can convert this to kg:\n\nMass = 8 * solar mass = 8 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 8 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\n\nSchwarzschild radius = 2.664e15 / 9e16 = 0.0296 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option is:\n\nA. 23599 m",
