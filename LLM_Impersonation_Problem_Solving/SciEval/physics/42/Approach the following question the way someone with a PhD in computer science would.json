    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the energy of a cosmic ray particle is related to the acceleration process. The energy of a cosmic ray particle can be determined using the equation E = qV, where E is the energy, q is the charge of the particle, and V is the potential difference the particle is accelerated through.\n\nIn this case, the energy of the cosmic ray particle is given as 4 TeV = 4e12 eV. We convert this into joules by using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. Therefore, the energy E = 4e12 eV * 1.6e-19 J = 6.4e-7 J.\n\nThe charge of the particle is the elementary charge e = 1.6e-19 C.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the potential difference V using the magnetic field strength B = 900 microgauss = 900e-6 T. The potential difference is given by V = B * d, where d is the distance the particle is accelerated through. Given that the distance d is not provided, we need to find an expression that relates the acceleration with the potential difference V.\n\nThe Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field is F = qvB, where F is the force, q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe acceleration of the particle can be calculated using Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the Lorentz force acting on the particle. Therefore, m * a = qvB.\n\nSince we are interested in the acceleration required to accelerate the particle through a potential difference V, we can express the velocity of the particle as v = sqrt(2qV/m).\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation m * a = q * sqrt(2qV/m) * B, we can simplify to find the expression for acceleration a = qVB / sqrt(2m).\n\nNow, substituting the given values into the expression, we find a = (1.6e-19 C * 900e-6 T * V) / sqrt(2 * m), where V is the potential difference and m is the mass of the particle.\n\nGiven the parameters and constants provided, we can calculate the acceleration required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 4 TeV from a supernova remnant shock wave with a magnetic field of 900 microgauss. The correct answer is option B.",
