Sure, here's a question that a physics student can solve related to Cosmic ray propagation and acceleration:\n\nWhat acceleration is required to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 4 TeV, assuming it originates from a supernova remnant shock wave with a magnetic field of 900 microgauss? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : elementary charge : e = 1.6e-19 C ; velocity of light : c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 2.02e-03 m/s^2\nB. 5.69e-03 m/s^2\nC. 7.87e-03 m/s^2\nD. 2.99e-03 m/s^2\n\nAnswer:",
