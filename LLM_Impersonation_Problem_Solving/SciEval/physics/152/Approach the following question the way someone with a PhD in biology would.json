    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 13 and 63 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, we can use the formula for the gravitational wave amplitude:\n\nh = (4/3) * (G/c^4) * (mu * M)^{5/3} * (pi * f)^{2/3} / r\n\nwhere h is the gravitational wave amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, c is the velocity of light, mu is the reduced mass of the binary system, M is the total mass of the binary system, f is the frequency of the gravitational waves, and r is the distance to the source.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the reduced mass of the binary system:\n\nmu = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nmu = (13 * 63) / (13 + 63) * 1.989e30 kg\nmu = 83670.1 * 1.989e30 kg\nmu = 1.666e36 kg\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of the binary system:\n\nM = m1 + m2\nM = 13 + 63\nM = 76 * 1.989e30 kg\nM = 1.50714e32 kg\n\nNow, we can use the given distance of 1 billion light-years to calculate the distance in meters:\n\ndistance = (1e9 * 9.461e15 m)\ndistance = 9.461e24 m\n\nSubstitute all the values into the formula for h and solve for h:\n\nh = (4/3) * (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 / (3e8 m/s)^4) * (1.666e36 kg * 1.50714e32 kg)^{5/3} * (pi * f)^{2/3} / 9.461e24 m\nh = 6.16e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 13 and 63 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth is approximately 6.16e-21.\n\nTo calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detector, we need to use the formula:\n\nSNR = h / sqrt( 4 * S_h(f) )\n\nwhere SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, h is the gravitational wave amplitude, and S_h(f) is the one-sided power spectral density of the detector noise.\n\nSince the answers provided do not include the value of S_h(f) for LIGO, we are unable to calculate the exact signal-to-noise ratio.",
