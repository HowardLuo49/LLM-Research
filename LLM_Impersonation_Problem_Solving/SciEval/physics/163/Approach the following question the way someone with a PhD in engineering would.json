    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula for the gravitational wave frequency, which is given by f = 2/P, where P is the orbital period of the binary system. In this case, P = 28 seconds, so the frequency would be f = 2/28 = 0.0714 Hz.\n\nNext, to calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula for the gravitational wave strain, which is given by h = (4/3) (G/c^4) (M\u03c9^2R^2)/r, where M is the reduced mass of the binary system, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, R is the distance between the black holes, and r is the distance between the binary system and Earth.\n\nThe reduced mass can be calculated as \u03bc = (m1*m2)/(m1+m2) = (17*59)/(17+59) = 12.615 solar masses = 2.51e31 kg. The angular frequency can be calculated as \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f = 2*3.14*0.0714 = 0.4486 rad/s. The distance between the black holes can be estimated as R = 2.00e9 km = 2.00e12 m. Assuming the binary system is at a distance of 1 light year = 9.461e15 m from Earth, the distance r = 9.461e15 m.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get h = (4/3) (6.674e-11/3e8^4) (2.51e31*0.4486^2*2.00e12^2)/9.461e15 = 7.61e-15.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is B. 7.61e-15. \n\nTo detect these gravitational waves, we can use instruments such as interferometers like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) that are sensitive enough to observe the tiny motions caused by passing gravitational waves.\n\nThe implications of detecting these waves are significant as they offer direct observational evidence of massive objects in space orbiting each other, validating aspects of general relativity, and providing insights into the behavior of black holes. Additionally, it opens up a new era of observational astronomy where we can study the universe in a completely different way.",
