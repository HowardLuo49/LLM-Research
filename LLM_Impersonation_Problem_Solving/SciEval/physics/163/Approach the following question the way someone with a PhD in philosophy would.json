    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system of two black holes with masses of 17 and 59 times the mass of the sun, we can use the formula for the orbital frequency of a binary system:\n\nf = (1/2\u03c0) \u221a(GM/r^3)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system, and r is the average separation between the black holes. We can calculate the total mass as:\n\nM = 17Msun + 59Msun = 76Msun\n\nUsing the orbital period T = 28 seconds, we can find the average separation r:\n\nr = (GMT^2 / 4\u03c0^2)^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting the values gives:\n\nr = ((6.674e-11)(76)(1.989e30)(28)^2 / (4\u03c0^2))^(1/3)\n\nr = 9.747e9 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency f:\n\nf = (1/2\u03c0) \u221a((6.674e-11)(76)(1.989e30) / (9.747e9)^3)\n\nf = 1.33e-5 Hz\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4/\u03c0) (GM/c^4) (r\u03c9^2 / r)\n\nwhere h is the strain amplitude, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, and r is the distance to the binary. Since the distance to the binary is very large compared to the wavelength (r ~ 1 light year), we can simplify the formula to:\n\nh = (4/\u03c0) (GM/c^2) (r\u03c9^2 / r)\n\nSubstitute the values to get:\n\nh = (4/\u03c0) (6.674e-11 / (3e8)^2) (9.747e9) (2\u03c0f)^2 / (9.461e15) \n\nh \u2248 7.01e-15\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nD. 7.01e-15\n\nTo detect these gravitational waves, we can use interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. The implications of detecting these waves would be monumental as they would confirm the existence of binary black hole systems and provide further evidence for the general theory of relativity. It would also open up new avenues for studying these extreme gravitational phenomena and improve our understanding of the universe.",
