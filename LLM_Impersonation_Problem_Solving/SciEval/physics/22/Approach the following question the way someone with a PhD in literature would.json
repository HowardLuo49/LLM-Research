The accretion disk is made up of material that is spiraling inward towards the black hole, which can lead to the emission of radiation and the release of energy. This release of energy can generate a strong outward force that can affect the star's orbit, causing it to either move closer or further away from the black hole depending on various factors such as the mass and angular momentum of the accretion disk. Additionally, the accretion disk can generate strong gravitational forces that can perturb the star's orbit, leading to changes in its trajectory.",
