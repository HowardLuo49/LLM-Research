    "gpt_response": "B. 203.91 km/s\n\nThe rotational velocity of an object in a circular orbit is given by the equation:\n\nv_rot = v_avg + v_rad\n\nWhere v_rot is the rotational velocity, v_avg is the average rotational velocity of the galactic disk at that distance (297 km/s), and v_rad is the observed radial velocity (239 km/s).\n\nTherefore, v_rot = 297 km/s + 239 km/s = 536 km/s\n\nHowever, this is the total velocity of the star. To find the rotational velocity, we need to subtract the radial velocity:\n\nv_rot = 536 km/s - 239 km/s = 297 km/s\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 203.91 km/s.",
