    "gpt_response": "To find the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 8 A, we can use Ampere's law in conjunction with the Biot-Savart law. Considering that the wire has a length of 3 cm, the magnetic field can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, we find the magnetic field at the center of the wire. The magnetic field at the center of a wire carrying a current can be found using the formula B = (\u03bc_0 * I)/(2\u03c0r), where B is the magnetic field, \u03bc_0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nAt the center of the wire (r = 1.5 cm), the magnetic field will be B = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 8)/(2\u03c0 * 0.015) = 0.106 T.\n\nNow, using the superposition principle, we can find the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire. This will involve integrating the magnetic field along the entire length of the wire. Since the wire is perpendicular to the direction of current flow, the contribution to the magnetic field will be perpendicular to the wire.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at a distance of 5 cm from the wire carrying a current of 8 A will be approximately 0.106 T.\n\nThus, the option that is closest to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 16.27 x 10^(-6) Tesla",
