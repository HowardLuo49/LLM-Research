    "gpt_response": "To determine the magnetic field strength at a certain distance from a straight wire carrying a current, we can utilize Ampere's law. Ampere's law states that the magnetic field strength (B) around a closed loop is equal to the permeability of free space (\\mu_0) multiplied by the current passing through the loop divided by 2\u03c0 times the distance from the wire.\n\nTherefore, the formula to calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance r from a straight wire is:\n\nB = (\\mu_0 * I) / (2\u03c0 * r)\n\nGiven that the current I is 8 A, the distance from the wire is 5 cm (0.05 m), and the length of the wire is 3 cm (0.03 m), we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\nB = (1.26 x 10^(-6) * 8) / (2\u03c0 * 0.05)\n\nB = (10.08 x 10^(-6)) / (0.314)\n\nB = 32.15 x 10^(-6) Tesla\n\nAmong the provided options, the closest answer to 32.15 x 10^(-6) Tesla is:\n\nC. 32.0 x 10^(-6) Tesla\n\nTherefore, I believe option C is the closest to the correct answer.",
