The formula for the magnetic field strength, B, around a long straight wire is given by:\n\nB = (\\mu_0 * I) / (2\u03c0r)\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field strength\n\\mu_0 = magnetic constant = 1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m)\nI = current = 8 A\nr = distance from the wire = 5 cm = 0.05 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 8) / (2\u03c0 * 0.05)\nB = 1.008 * 10^(-5) / (0.314)\nB = 32.16 * 10^(-6) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option is C. 32.0 x 10^(-6) Tesla.",
