    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes orbiting each other, we can use the formula for gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf = 1/(Pi * M * Co)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, M is the total mass of the system, and Co is the orbital period.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of the system:\nM_total = 33 * mass_sun + 65 * mass_sun\nM_total = 33 * 1.989e30 kg + 65 * 1.989e30 kg\nM_total = 195.987e30 kg\n\nNext, we calculate the frequency:\nf = 1/(3.14 * 195.987e30 kg * 35 s)\nf = 1/(3.14 * 195.987e30 kg * 35 s)\nf = 1/(6.1174e32 kg\u00b7s)\n\nThis gives us a frequency of:\nf = 1.63e-33 Hz\n\nNext, we calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth. The amplitude can be found using the following formula:\n\nh = (4 * G * M * \u03c9^2) / (c^4 * R)\n\nwhere h is the amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, M is the total mass of the system, \u03c9 is the angular frequency (2 * Pi * f), c is the velocity of light, and R is the distance from the source to the observer (assuming 1 light year).\n\nFirst, we calculate the angular frequency:\n\u03c9 = 2 * Pi * 1.63e-33 Hz\n\u03c9 = 3.24e-33 rad/s\n\nNext, we calculate the amplitude:\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 195.987e30 kg * (3.24e-33 rad/s)^2) / (3e8 m/s)^4 * 1 light year)\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 195.987e30 kg * 1.05424e-65 rad^2) / (81e16 m^4)\nh = 5.899e-37\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth is 5.899e-37.\n\nFinally, for the implications of detecting these waves, the detection of gravitational waves from black hole binaries can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of these extreme cosmic phenomena. By studying the properties of gravitational waves, scientists can test and further develop Einstein's general theory of relativity, explore the nature of black holes, and gain new knowledge about the structure of the universe. Additionally, the detection of gravitational waves opens up a new window into the universe and offers a unique way of observing celestial events that are invisible to traditional telescopes.",
