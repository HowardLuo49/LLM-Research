What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 33 and 65 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 35 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them?

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0) * sqrt((G * M_total) / (a^3))\n\nwhere:\nf = frequency of gravitational waves\nG = gravitational constant\nM_total = total mass of the binary system\na = semi-major axis of the orbit\n\nGiven that the masses of the two black holes are 33 and 65 times the mass of the sun, the total mass (M_total) would be (33 + 65) times the mass of the sun. Therefore, M_total = 98 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nTo calculate the semi-major axis (a), we can use Kepler's third law:\n\na^3 = (T^2 * G * M_total) / (4\u03c0^2)\n\nwhere:\nT = orbital period in seconds\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula to find the semi-major axis (a). Then, plug the values of G, M_total, and a into the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves. It is important to convert the calculated frequency to Hz.\n\nFor the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, it would depend on the distance to the binary system and the masses of the black holes.
