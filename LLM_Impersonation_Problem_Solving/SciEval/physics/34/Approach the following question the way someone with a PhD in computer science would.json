What is the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, assuming a diffusion coefficient of 410^28 cm^2/s and a magnetic field strength of 8 microgauss? How does this maximum energy change if the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 10? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : elementary charge :e = 1.6e-19 C ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.
