    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 32400 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit.\n\nGiven that the star is in a circular orbit, the semi-major axis (a) would be equal to the distance from the center of the galaxy, which is 32400 light years converted to meters: 32400 light years * 9.461e15 m/light year = 3.06e20 meters.\n\nThe orbital period can then be calculated using the following formula:\nT^2 = (4 * pi^2 * a^3)/(G * mass of the galaxy)\n\nSubstitute the known constants:\nT^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 * (3.06e20)^3)/(6.674e-11 * mass of the Milky Way galaxy)\n\nThe mass of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 1.989e42 kg (based on the known solar mass).\n\nCalculate T^2:\nT^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 * (3.06e20)^3)/(6.674e-11 * 1.989e42)\nT^2 = 8.69e16\nT = sqrt(8.69e16)\nT = 9.33e08 seconds\n\nConvert seconds to years:\nT = 9.33e08 seconds / (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year)\nT = 2.96e+01 years\n\nTherefore, the expected orbital period of the star located at a distance of 32400 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy is closest to option C: 8.69e+08 years.",
