    "gpt_response": "To calculate the orbital period of a star in a circular orbit around the galactic center, we can use Kepler's third law of planetary motion, which states:\n\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2 / G * (M + m)) * a^3\n\nWhere T is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, m is the mass of the star, and a is the distance of the star from the galactic center.\n\nGiven:\nDistance from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, a = 32400 light years = 32400 * 9.461e15 m\nMass of the Milky Way galaxy, M = 2.5e12 solar masses = 2.5e12 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nPlugging in the values, we have:\nT^2 = (4 * \u03c0^2 / G * (M)) * a^3\nT^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 / 6.674e-11 * (2.5e12 * 1.989e30)) * (32400 * 9.461e15)^3\n\nCalculating this expression, we get:\nT^2 = (0.262 / 3.3357e45) * (8.212178e21)\n\nT^2 = 6.5275e-46 * 5.2629e64\nT^2 = 3.4347e19\n\nTaking the square root of this value gives us the orbital period T:\nT = 5.86e09 seconds\n\nConverting this to years by dividing by the number of seconds in a year (3.1536e7 seconds), we get:\nT = 1.86e02 years\n\nTherefore, the expected orbital period of a star located 32400 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy is approximately 1.86 x 10^2 years, which is closest to option B: 1.99e+08 years.",
