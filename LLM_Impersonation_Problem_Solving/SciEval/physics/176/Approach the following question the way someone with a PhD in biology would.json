Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 25071 m\nB. 23599 m\nC. 39382 m\nD. 99408 m\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a black hole, beyond which no information can escape due to the extreme gravitational pull of the black hole. It is defined as rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius using the formula rs = 2 * G * (8 * solar mass) / c^2.\n\nSubstitute the known values:\nrs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * (8 * 1.989e30) / (3e8)^2\nrs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 1.5912e31 / 9e16\nrs = 2 * 1.06257e20 / 9e16\nrs = 2 * 1.18063e3\nrs = 2,361.26 meters\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 23599 m.",
