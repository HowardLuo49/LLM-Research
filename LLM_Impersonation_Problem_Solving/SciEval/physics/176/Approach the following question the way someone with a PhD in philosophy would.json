Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, denoted as Rs, is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole. It represents the radius at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape. It can be calculated using the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, which is equivalent to 8 * 1.989e30 kg, we can substitute the values into the formula to calculate the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 8 * 1.989e30 / 3e8^2 = 23598.75 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 23599 m.",
