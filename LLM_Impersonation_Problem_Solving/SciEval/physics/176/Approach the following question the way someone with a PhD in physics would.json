Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 8 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is the radius at which the gravitational pull of a mass becomes so great that not even light can escape from it, resulting in the formation of a black hole. It is calculated using the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 8 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius as follows:\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 8 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nRs = 3190394528 / 900000000\nRs \u2248 3544.882 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nC. 39382 m",
