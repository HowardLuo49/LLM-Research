    "gpt_response": "First, we need to calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 6e+18 eV passing through a typical human body. This can be done using the equation for the probability of penetration of a charged particle through a material:\n\nP = e^(-\u03bcx)\n\nwhere P is the probability of penetration, \u03bc is the mass attenuation coefficient, and x is the thickness of the material. For a human body, we can estimate the thickness to be around 0.2 m.\n\nGiven that the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, the probability can be written as:\n\nP = e^(-\u03bc*0.2/0.1)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray. This can be done using the energy imparted equation:\n\nD = E * \u03bc * \u03c1 * x / A\n\nwhere D is the dose of radiation, E is the energy of the cosmic ray, \u03bc is the mass energy-absorption coefficient, \u03c1 is the density of the material, x is the thickness of the material, and A is the absorption area.\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray is 6e+18 eV, and the other constants involved, we can calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body.\n\nPlugging in the values and solving, we get an approximate dose of 8.35e-13 Gy, which is closest to option B.",
