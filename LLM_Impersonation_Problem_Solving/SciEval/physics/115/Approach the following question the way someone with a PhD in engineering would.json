Given that the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, we can calculate the probability of interaction.\n\nThe cross-section (\u03c3) of a typical human body can be estimated to be around 1 m^2. Using the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, the probability of interaction (P) can be calculated as:\n\nP = A / \u03c3\nP = 0.1 / 1\nP = 0.1\n\nTherefore, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through a typical human body is 0.1.\n\nTo estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose.
