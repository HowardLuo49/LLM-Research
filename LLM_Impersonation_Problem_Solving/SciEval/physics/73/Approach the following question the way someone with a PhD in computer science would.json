What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 5.8 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 97 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.
