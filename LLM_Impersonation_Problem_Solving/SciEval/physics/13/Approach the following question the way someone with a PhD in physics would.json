    "gpt_response": "To find the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = 2\u03c0 * Average radius / rotational velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average radius from light-years to meters:\n\nAverage radius = 73167 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 6.92e+17 m.\n\nNext, we need to determine the rotational velocity. The rotational velocity of the Milky Way is approximately 220 km/s. Converting this to m/s:\n\nRotational velocity = 220 km/s * 1e3 m/km = 2.2e5 m/s.\n\nNow we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nRotational period = 2\u03c0 * 6.92e+17 m / 2.2e5 m/s = 6.88e12 s.\n\nFinally, we can convert this into years:\n\nRotational period = 6.88e12 s / (60 s/min * 60 min/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year) \u2248 2.18e05 years.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is:\n\nB. 3.06e+08 years.",
