What is the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 41590 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m.

    "gpt_response": "The expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 41590 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy can be calculated using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) of an object in circular orbit is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (r) of its orbit.\n\nGiven that the distance from the star to the center of the Milky Way galaxy is the semi-major axis of the orbit, we can calculate the orbital period using the formula: T = \u221a(4\u03c0^2/ (G * M)) * r^(3/2), where M is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThe mass of the Milky Way galaxy can be estimated to be approximately 1e12 solar masses. Thus, M = 1e12 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.989e42 kg.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\nT = \u221a(4\u03c0^2/ (6.674e-11 * 1.989e42)) * (41590 * 9.461e15)^(3/2)\n\nT = \u221a(4\u03c0^2/ (1.326e32)) * (393236500e15)^(3/2)\nT = \u221a(0.000000000000000000000000000000003007) * 367156144169853925e15\nT = 7.97e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the expected orbital period of the star is A. 7.97e+08 years.",
