    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = (2 * \u03c0 * R) / V\n\nwhere T is the rotational period, R is the average radius of the galactic halo, and V is the velocity of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average radius from light-years to meters:\n\n77122 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 7.294e20 m\n\nNow we can plug in the values to calculate the rotational period:\n\nT = (2 * 3.14 * 7.294e20) / 3e8\nT = 4.86e12 seconds\n\nTo convert this to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days):\n\nT = 4.86e12 / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365)\nT = 1.54e05 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 1.7e+08 years",
