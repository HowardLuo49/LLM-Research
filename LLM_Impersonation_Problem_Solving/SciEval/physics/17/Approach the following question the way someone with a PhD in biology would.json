    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = circumference / rotational velocity\n\nFirst, we need to find the circumference of a circle with a radius of 77122 light-years:\ncircumference = 2 * pi * radius\ncircumference = 2 * 3.14 * 77122 light-years\ncircumference = 484571.04 light-years\n\nNext, we need to convert the circumference from light-years to meters:\n1 light-year = 9.461e15 meters\ncircumference_meters = 484571.04 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year\ncircumference_meters = 4.58e21 meters\n\nNow, we need to find the rotational velocity of the Milky Way's galactic halo. Since the Milky Way's galactic halo is a part of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use the rotational speed of the Milky Way galaxy, which is approximately 220 km/s.\n\nConverting the rotational speed from km/s to m/s:\nrotational velocity = 220 km/s * 1000 m/km\nrotational velocity = 220,000 m/s\n\nNow we can calculate the rotational period:\nrotational period = circumference / rotational velocity\nrotational period = 4.58e21 meters / 220,000 m/s\nrotational period = 2.08e16 seconds\n\nFinally, we can convert the rotational period from seconds to years:\n1 year = 3.154e7 seconds\nrotational period_years = 2.08e16 seconds / 3.154e7 seconds/year\nrotational period_years = 6.61e8 years\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is A. 6.61e+08 years.",
