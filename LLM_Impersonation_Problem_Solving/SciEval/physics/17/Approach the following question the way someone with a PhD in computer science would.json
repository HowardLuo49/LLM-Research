What is the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, given its average radius of 77122 light-years? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 6.61e+08 years\nB. 4.97e+08 years\nC. 1.7e+08 years\nD. 4.1e+08 years\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2\u03c0r / v\n\nwhere T is the rotational period, r is the average radius of the galactic halo (77122 light-years converted to meters), and v is the velocity of light (c).\n\nFirst, we convert the average radius from light-years to meters:\n77122 light-years * 9.461e15 = 7.299e20 meters\n\nNext, we substitute the values into the formula:\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 7.299e20 / 3e8\n\nT = 4.647e13 seconds\n\nTo convert seconds to years:\n4.647e13 seconds * (1 year / 3.15576e7 seconds) = 1.47e6 years\n\nTherefore, the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo is approximately 1.47 million years. The closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 1.7e+08 years\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 1.7e+08 years.",
