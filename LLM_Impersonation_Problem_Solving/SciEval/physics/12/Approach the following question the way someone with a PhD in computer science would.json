    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we first need to determine the circumference of the halo at the given average radius.\n\nCircumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\nCircumference = 2 * 3.14 * 41149 light-years\nCircumference = 258287.24 light-years\n\nNext, we need to convert the circumference from light-years to meters by using the conversion factor provided.\n\nCircumference = 258287.24 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year\nCircumference = 2.4424e21 meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the linear speed of the galactic halo by dividing the circumference by the rotational period.\n\nLinear speed = Circumference / Rotational period\n\nWe know that linear speed is also equal to radius * angular speed, and angular speed is given by:\n\nAngular speed = Linear speed / radius\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nAngular speed = Circumference / (Rotational period * radius)\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for the rotational period:\n\nRotational period = Circumference / (Angular speed * radius)\n\nThe linear speed of the galactic halo is assumed to be the speed of light, c = 3e8 m/s. Therefore,\n\nRotational period = 2.4424e21 meters / (3e8 m/s * 41149 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year)\nRotational period = 5.27e8 seconds\n\nConverting this to years, we get:\n\nRotational period = 5.27e8 seconds / (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 365.25 days/year)\nRotational period \u2248 4.01e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 4.01e+08 years.",
