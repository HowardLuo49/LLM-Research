    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius defining the size of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is the distance from the center of the black hole at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light. This radius is given by the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nSubstituting the values given, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 9 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 9 * 1.989e30 / 9e16\nRs = 2 * 1.2006e20 / 9e16\nRs = 2.4012e20 / 9e16\nRs = 2.668e4\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is C. 26549 m.",
