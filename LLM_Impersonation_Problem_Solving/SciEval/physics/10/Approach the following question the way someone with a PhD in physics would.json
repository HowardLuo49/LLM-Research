Calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses, a radius of 21 kilometers, and an accretion rate of 0.2 solar masses per year. Assume the disk is made of gas that is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium and has a temperature of 10 million Kelvin. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole, we need to consider the energy released due to the mass accretion. The formula for calculating the energy released in the accretion disk is:\n\nE = mc^2,\n\nwhere E is the energy released, m is the mass accreted, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the amount of mass accreted in one year, which is 0.2 solar masses:\n\nm = 0.2 * 1.989e30 kg = 3.978e29 kg.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the energy released due to the accretion of this mass:\n\nE = 3.978e29 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 3.5782e46 J.\n\nThis is the total energy released over one year. To find the energy released in one second, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (3.1536e7 seconds):\n\nE_yearly = 3.5782e46 J / 3.1536e7 s = 1.1347e39 J.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the disk is made of gas, which is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium. The energy released per gram of hydrogen is 6.3e-12 J, and per gram of helium is 6.32e-12 J.\n\nAssuming that the total mass of the disk is dominated by hydrogen:\n\nE_hydrogen = 0.1 * 3.978e29 kg * 6.3e-12 J = 2.5122e18 J.\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the accretion disk of the black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses, radius of 21 kilometers, accretion rate of 0.2 solar masses per year, and disk temperature of 10 million Kelvin is approximately:\n\nE_total = 1.1347e39 J + 2.5122e18 J = 1.1347e39 J.\n\nThe closest answer to the correct one is:\n\nA. 7.83e+38 J.",
