    "gpt_response": "B. 3000.0 k\n\nTo calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of a black body radiator in terms of the cosmic microwave background temperature T0 and the scale factor a:\n\nT = T0 / a\n\nGiven that T0 = 2.73 k, we need to calculate the scale factor a at the time 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The scale factor a is related to the time elapsed since the Big Bang (t) by the formula:\n\na = (t / t0)^(2/3)\n\nwhere t0 is the age of the universe at the time of the cosmic microwave background radiation (about 380,000 years).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na = (380,000 years / 380,000 years)^(2/3) = 1\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is:\n\nT = 2.73 k / 1 = 2.73 k\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 k, which is closest to option B (3000.0 k).",
