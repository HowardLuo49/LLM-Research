    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength can be calculated using the formula \u03bb_peak = b / T, where b is a constant (2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K) and T is the temperature. \n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, we know that the black body spectrum for the cosmic microwave background radiation has a peak wavelength of 1.06 mm. \n\nWe can use this information to solve for the temperature T using the formula \u03bb_peak = b / T:\n\n1.06 x 10^-3 m = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K / T\n\nT = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m / 1.06 x 10^-3 m = 2.73 K \n\nThus, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K, which is the same as the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (T0).\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3000.0 K",
