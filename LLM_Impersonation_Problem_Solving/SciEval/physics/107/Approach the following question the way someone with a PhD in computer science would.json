    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the peak frequency of a black body spectrum:\n\nf_peak = 2.82 * T\n\nWhere f_peak is the peak frequency and T is the temperature. Since the universe was completely ionized at that time, the temperature T can be calculated as:\n\nT = T0 / Sqrt(1 + z)\n\nWhere T0 = 2.73 k is the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and z is the redshift at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = 1 / (1 + a)\n\nWhere a is the scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Using the formula for the scale factor:\n\na = (time after Big Bang) / (current age of the universe)\n\nGiven that the current age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, and converting 380,000 years to seconds, we can calculate the scale factor a and then the redshift z. Plugging this into the temperature formula, we can then calculate the temperature T. \n\nAfter performing the necessary calculations, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 6063.66 k",
