    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of Wien's displacement law for black body radiation. \n\nThe peak wavelength of the radiation emitted by a black body is given by the formula \u03bbmax = (2.897 x 10^(-3) m*K) / T, where T is the temperature in Kelvin. \n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe can be calculated by setting the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation equal to the wavelength corresponding to T0 = 2.73 K. \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n(2.897 x 10^(-3) m*K) / T = (2.897 x 10^(-3) m*K) / 2.73 K\n\nSolving for T, we get T = 2.73 K * (2.73 / T0)\n\nT = 2.73 K * (2.73 / 2.73 K) = 2.73 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K. \n\nAmong the given choices, the closest answer is B. 3000.0 K, but the more accurate value based on calculations is 2.73 K.",
