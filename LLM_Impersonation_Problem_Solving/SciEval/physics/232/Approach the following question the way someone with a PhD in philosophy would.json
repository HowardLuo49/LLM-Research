    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop carrying a current, one must consider the Biot-Savart law. This law states that the magnetic field (\\vec{B}) at a point in space due to a current-carrying wire is given by the formula:\n\n\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{I \\vec{dl} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2}\n\nWhere:\n- \\vec{B} is the magnetic field\n- \\mu_0 is the magnetic constant\n- I is the current\n- \\vec{dl} is the length element of the wire\n- \\hat{r} is the unit vector pointing from the current element to the point where the magnetic field is being calculated\n- r is the distance between the current element and the point where the magnetic field is being calculated\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is at the center of the rectangular loop.
