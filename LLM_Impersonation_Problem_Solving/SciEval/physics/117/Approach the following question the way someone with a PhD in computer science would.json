    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 6e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the equation P = e^(-N\u03c3x), where P is the probability, N is the number of atoms in the body, \u03c3 is the cross-section for interaction, and x is the thickness of the material.\n\nGiven that the energy of the cosmic ray is 6e+18 eV, we convert this energy to joules: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J, so the energy of the cosmic ray is 6e+18 * 1.602176634e-19 = 9.61e-1 J.\n\nThe number of atoms in a human body is approximately 7e27 atoms.\n\nThe cross-section for interaction of high-energy cosmic rays with biological matter is approximately 6e-26 m^2.\n\nAssuming the thickness of the human body is negligible compared to the energy of the cosmic ray, we can calculate the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body: P = e^(-7e27 * 6e-26 * 0.1) = 5.47e-13\n\nNext, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we can use the absorbed dose equation: D = E * P / A, where D is the absorbed dose, E is the energy of the cosmic ray, P is the probability of interaction, and A is the absorption area.\n\nPlugging in the values: D = 9.61e-1 * 5.47e-13 / 0.1 = 5.25e-13 Gy\n\nTherefore, the closest correct answer from the given choices is option A: 5.47e-13 Gy.",
