    "gpt_response": "Given:\nEnergy of cosmic ray, E = 6e+18 eV = 6 x 10^18 eV\nAbsorption area, A = 0.1 m^2\n\nTo calculate the probability of a cosmic ray passing through a human body, we can consider it as a form of attenuation with a certain probability of interaction. The probability of interaction in this case can be related to the mean free path of the cosmic ray in the human body.\n\nThe mean free path, \u03bb is given by:\n\u03bb = 1 / (n * \u03c3)\nwhere,\nn is the number density of particles in the body\n\u03c3 is the cross-section for interaction\n\nThe cross-section for interaction will depend on the energy of the cosmic ray and the material it is interacting with (in this case, the human body).\n\nOnce the probability of interaction is calculated, we can then estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body. This can be calculated using the following formula:\nDose = Energy absorbed / Absorption area\n\nThe energy absorbed will depend on the energy of the cosmic ray and the probability of interaction.\n\nWithout further information and specific values for n and \u03c3, it is not possible to accurately calculate the probability of a cosmic ray passing through a human body and the dose of ionizing radiation received.
