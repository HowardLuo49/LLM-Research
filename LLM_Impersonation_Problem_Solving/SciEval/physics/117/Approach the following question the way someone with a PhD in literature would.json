    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 6e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the cross-section of the human body and the energy of the cosmic ray. Let's assume the cross-section of a human body is approximately 0.1 m^2.\n\nThe interaction cross-section of a typical human for high-energy cosmic rays is about 1 barn (1 barn = 1e-28 m^2). Therefore, the probability of interaction for the given energy of 6e+18 eV is:\n\nProbability = Cross-section/Area = 1e-28 m^2 / 0.1 m^2 = 1e-29\n\nNow, to calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose formula:\n\nAbsorbed Dose = Energy of the cosmic ray * Probability\n\nAbsorbed Dose = 6e+18 eV * 1e-29 = 6e-11 J = 6e-11 Gy\n\nGiven the options, the closest answer is:\n\nA. 5.47e-13 Gy\n\nTherefore, option A is the closest estimate to the correct answer.",
