    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula:\n\nf = 1/(2\u03c0) * (G(M1 + M2)/(c^3 * a^3))^(1/2)\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, c is the velocity of light, G is the gravitational constant, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Given that the masses of the black holes are 19 and 34 times the mass of the sun, the total mass is 53 times the mass of the sun. Let's convert the mass to kg:\n\nM_total = 53 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.054e32 kg\n\nThe semi-major axis can be related to the orbital period by the formula:\n\na = (G(M1 + M2)/(4\u03c0^2 * T^2))^(1/3)\n\nwhere T is the orbital period, which is 65 seconds in this case. Now we can calculate the semi-major axis:\n\na = ((6.674e-11 * 1.054e32)/(4*3.14^2 * 65^2))^(1/3) = 2.373e11 m\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf = 1/(2*3.14) * (6.674e-11 * 1.054e32)/(3e8)^3 * 2.373e11^3)^0.5 = 8.43e-15 Hz\n\nSo the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the black holes is 8.43e-15 Hz.\n\nNext, to calculate the amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4/5) * (G(M1 * M2)/(c^4 * r)) * (\u03c0 * f)^2\n\nwhere r is the distance from the source to the Earth. Assuming a distance of 1 light year (9.461e15 m), we can calculate the amplitude:\n\nh = (4/5) * (6.674e-11 * 19 * 34)/(3e8)^4 * 9.461e15) * (\u03c0 * 8.43e-15)^2 = 6.46e-16\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the waves reaching Earth is approximately 6.46e-16.\n\nTo detect these waves, we can use interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) or Virgo. When these waves are detected, it can provide valuable information about the black holes, their masses, spins, and orbital dynamics. It can also help test Einstein's theory of general relativity under extreme conditions and further our understanding of the universe. \n\nBased on the calculations and implications mentioned above, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nB. 6.46e-16.",
