What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (4.8solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.59e+47 J\nB. 5.87e+48 J\nC. 1.25e+48 J\nD. 2.61e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass converted into energy, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 4.8 solar masses, we can convert this to kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg). So, the mass of the white dwarf star is 4.8 * 1.989e30 kg = 9.5712e30 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\n\nE = 9.5712e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 9.5712e30 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 8.61408e47 J\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is A. 8.59e+47 J.",
