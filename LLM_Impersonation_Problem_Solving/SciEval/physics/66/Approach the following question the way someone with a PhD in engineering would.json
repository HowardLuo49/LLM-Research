What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (4.8solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To determine the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for energy equivalence (E=mc^2), where m is the mass of the white dwarf star and c is the velocity of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star into kilograms:\nMass of white dwarf star = 4.8 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 9.55e30 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the energy released using the formula:\nEnergy released = (mass of white dwarf star) * (velocity of light)^2\nEnergy released = 9.55e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nEnergy released = 9.55e30 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nEnergy released = 8.595e47 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nA. 8.59e+47 J.",
