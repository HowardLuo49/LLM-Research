    "gpt_response": "In a Type Ia supernova explosion, a white dwarf star undergoes a thermonuclear explosion, resulting in the entire mass of the star being converted into energy. To calculate the kinetic energy released in such an explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the star and v is the velocity of the explosion.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 4.8 solar masses, and one solar mass is equal to 1.989e30 kg, the mass of the star in kilograms would be:\n4.8 * 1.989e30 kg = 9.5592e30 kg\n\nSince all of the mass is converted into energy, we can use Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 to calculate the equivalent energy. Therefore, the energy released in the explosion would be:\nE = 9.5592e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 8.60328e46 J or 8.59e+47 J (option A).\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer would be A. 8.59e+47 J.",
