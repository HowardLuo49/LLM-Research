    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation assuming it to be a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation curve is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nThe peak frequency of the radiation is 553.3 GHz. We can use the relationship c = f * \u03bb, where c is the speed of light, f is the frequency, and \u03bb is the wavelength. Solving for wavelength, we get \u03bb = c / f. Substituting c = 3 x 10^8 m/s and f = 553.3 x 10^9 Hz, we find \u03bb = 3 x 10^8 / 553.3 x 10^9 = 0.542 mm or 542 micrometers.\n\nNow, using Wien's displacement law, we know that \u03bb * T = constant, where T is the temperature. Given the peak wavelength of 542 micrometers, we can solve for T:\n\n542 micrometers = 2.9 mm * k / T\nT = 2.9 mm / 0.542 mm = 5.35 k\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 5.35 Kelvin, which is closest to option A (5.34 k).",
