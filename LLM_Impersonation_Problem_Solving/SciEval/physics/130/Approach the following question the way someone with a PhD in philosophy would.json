    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation assuming it to be a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The equation for Wien's displacement law is \u03bb_peak = b / T, where \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m-K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 553.3 GHz, we can use the relationship between frequency and wavelength for electromagnetic radiation, f = c / \u03bb, where f is frequency, c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 x 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is wavelength. Rearranging for wavelength, we get \u03bb = c / f.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get \u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (553.3 x 10^9 Hz) = 5.42 x 10^-4 m = 542 nm.\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to calculate the temperature: T = b / \u03bb_peak = (2.898 x 10^-3 m-K) / (5.42 x 10^-4 m) \u2248 5.34 K.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 5.34 K",
