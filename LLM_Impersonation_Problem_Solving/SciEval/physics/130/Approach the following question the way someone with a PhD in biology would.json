    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's Law, which states that the wavelength at which a blackbody spectrum peaks is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's Law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2898 \u00b5m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 553.3 GHz, we can use the relationship between frequency and wavelength:\n\nc = \u03bb * \u03bd\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and \u03bd is the frequency in Hz.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / \u03bd_peak\n\nSubstitute the values to calculate \u03bb_peak:\n\n\u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (553.3 x 10^9 Hz) = 5.42 x 10^-4 m = 542 \u00b5m\n\nNow, we can use Wien's Law to calculate the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak = 2898 \u00b5m*K / 542 \u00b5m = 5.35 K\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice would be:\n\nA. 5.34 K",
