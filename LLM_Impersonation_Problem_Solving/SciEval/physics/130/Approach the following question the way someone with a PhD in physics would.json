    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for this relationship is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = constant\n\nFirst, we need to convert the frequency of the radiation from GHz to Hz. \nGiven that the frequency peaks at 553.3 GHz, we have f = 553.3 * 10^9 Hz.\n\nUsing the formula \u03bb_peak = c / f, where c is the speed of light (3 * 10^8 m/s), we can calculate the peak wavelength as \u03bb_peak = 3 * 10^8 / (553.3 * 10^9) = 5.42 * 10^-4 m, or 542 nm. \n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature. Rearranging the formula, we get T = constant / \u03bb_peak. \nThe constant for this calculation is approximately 2.898 * 10^-3 m*K. \n\nTherefore, T = 2.898 * 10^-3 / (5.42 * 10^-4) = 5.34 K.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice from the given options is A. 5.34 k.",
