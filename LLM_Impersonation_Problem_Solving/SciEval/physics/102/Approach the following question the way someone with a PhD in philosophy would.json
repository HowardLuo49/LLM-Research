    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law to relate the peak wavelength of the radiation to the temperature of the radiation. The formula for Wien's displacement law is \u03bb_max = b/T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.9 mm K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, we can use the peak wavelength to calculate the temperature. The peak wavelength of the CMB radiation is approximately 1 mm, which corresponds to a temperature of approximately 2900 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3000 K.",
