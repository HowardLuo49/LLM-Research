    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum to its temperature. \n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is about 1.06 mm. Using the formula \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) and T is the temperature, we can solve for the temperature:\n\n1.06 x 10^-3 m = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / T\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / (1.06 x 10^-3 m) \n\nT \u2248 2.73 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K, which is option C: 3000.0 K.",
