    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is given by \u03bb_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.9 mm K) and T is the temperature.\n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was completely ionized, which means it was in a state of thermal equilibrium with a blackbody spectrum. This implies that the temperature of the universe at that time was equal to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation today, which is approximately T0 = 2.73 K.\n\nSubstitute T0 = 2.73 K into the equation \u03bb_max = b / T and solve for T:\n\u03bb_max = 2.9 mm K / T\n2.73 K = 2.9 mm K / T\nT = 2.9 mm K / 2.73 K\nT \u2248 1.06 mm \u2248 1060 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 1060 K.\n\nAmong the given choices, the closest answer is C. 3000.0 K.
