    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we first need to understand the concept of black body radiation and the cosmic microwave background radiation. A black body spectrum is a spectrum of radiation in which the intensity of radiation emitted at different wavelengths is given by Planck's law. The cosmic microwave background radiation is the radiation left over from the Big Bang and has a black body spectrum.\n\nThe temperature of a black body radiator at any given time can be calculated using Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of the radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. This law is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength in meters and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was completely ionized, and the temperature can be calculated using the above formula. The peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is found to be around 1.1 mm, corresponding to a temperature of approximately 3000 K. \n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3000.0 k",
