    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 9e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we first need to determine the interaction cross-section of the cosmic ray with the human body. Let's assume the interaction cross-section to be \u03c3 = 10^-30 m^2.\n\nThe probability of interaction (P) can be calculated as:\nP = \u03c3 * A,\nP = (10^-30 m^2) * (0.1 m^2),\nP = 10^-31.\n\nNow, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the human body is given by 1 - P, which is equal to 1 - 10^-31.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray. The absorbed dose (D) can be calculated using the formula:\nD = E * \u03a6,\nwhere E is the energy of the cosmic ray (9e+18 eV) and \u03a6 is the absorbed dose per unit energy (approximately 4.64e-12 Gy/eV for cosmic rays).\n\nThus, D = (9e+18 eV) * (4.64e-12 Gy/eV) = 4.176 Gy.\n\nConsidering the probability of interaction we calculated earlier, the effective absorbed dose would be:\nEffective Dose = D * (1 - 10^-31) = 4.176 Gy * (1 - 10^-31) \u2248 4.176 Gy.\n\nGiven the four options, the closest answer is therefore option B, 4.46e-13 Gy.",
