    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 9e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we need to consider the human body as a target of area A = 0.1 m^2. The probability of interaction (P) for a particle passing through a target of area A is given by P = A / (2R), where R is the radius of the target (assuming a cylindrical geometry for simplicity).\n\nThe radius of a typical human body can be estimated to be around 0.35 m. Therefore, the probability of interaction for a cosmic ray with energy 9e+18 eV passing through a human body is:\n\nP = 0.1 / (2*0.35) = 0.1429.\n\nNow, in order to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose (D) which is given by D = P * E, where E is the energy of the cosmic ray.\n\nGiven that the energy of the cosmic ray is 9e+18 eV, the absorbed dose can be calculated as:\n\nD = 0.1429 * 9e+18 = 1.2861e+18 eV.\n\nTo convert this absorbed dose into Gy, we can use the conversion factor 1 Gy = 1 J/kg = 1e7 eV/kg. Therefore, the absorbed dose in Gy is:\n\nD = 1.2861e+18 * 1e-7 = 1.2861e+11 Gy.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices, the closest answer is:\n\nB. 4.46e-13 Gy.",
