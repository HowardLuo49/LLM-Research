    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and b is Wien's displacement constant, which is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven that the frequency peak is around 434.4 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the relation c = \u03bb*f, where c is the speed of light. Thus:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f = 3 x 10^8 m/s / (434.4 x 10^9 Hz) = 6.91 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow, we can rearrange Wien's displacement law to solve for T:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / (6.91 x 10^-4 m) = 4.19 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.2 K.",
