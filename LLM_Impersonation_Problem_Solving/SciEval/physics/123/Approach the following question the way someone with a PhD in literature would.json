    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. Given that the frequency peaks at 434.4 GHz, we can first convert this to wavelength using the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s) and the formula lambda = c/frequency. \n\nThus, the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency of 434.4 GHz is:\nlambda = 3 x 10^8 / 434.4 x 10^9 = 6.9 x 10^-4 meters.\n\nNow, using Wien's displacement law, we can find the temperature of the radiation by the formula lambda * T = constant, where the constant is approximately equal to 2.9 mmK. Therefore, T = constant / lambda = 2.9 / 6.9 x 10^-4 = 4205 K.\n\nGiven the choices provided, the answer closest to this calculated temperature would be D. 4.2 k.",
