    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 434.4 GHz, we can use the relation between frequency and wavelength: c = \u03bb * f, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nSo, the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency of 434.4 GHz is:\n\u03bb = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (434.4 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.6908 mm.\n\nNow, to find the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we use the peak wavelength (0.6908 mm) to calculate the corresponding temperature using Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = 2.898 x 10^-3 m * K\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m * K) / 0.6908 x 10^-3 m = 4.2 K\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nD. 4.2 K",
