    "gpt_response": "To determine the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula for calculating the period of a circular orbit: T = 2\u03c0r/v, where T is the period, r is the radius, and v is the velocity.\n\nGiven the average radius of the galactic halo as 35850 light-years, we first need to convert this to meters using the conversion factor provided: 1 light-year = 9.461e15 meters. So, the radius in meters is 35850 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 3.39e20 m.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the velocity of the Milky Way's galactic halo. This information is not provided, so we will make an assumption that it is equal to the velocity of light, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get: T = 2\u03c0 * 3.39e20 m / 3e8 m/s = 2\u03c0 * 3.39e12 s = 6.73e12 s.\n\nTo convert the period from seconds to years, we divide the calculated value by the number of seconds in a year: 6.73e12 s / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) \u2248 2.13e5 years.\n\nAmong the given options: \nA. 3.07e+08 years\nB. 7.5e+08 years\nC. 3.54e+08 years\nD. 4.07e+08 years\n\nOption C, 3.54e+08 years is the closest to the correct answer of approximately 2.13e5 years.",
