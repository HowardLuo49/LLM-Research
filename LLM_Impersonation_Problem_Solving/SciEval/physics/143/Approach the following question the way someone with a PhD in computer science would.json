    "gpt_response": "To calculate the minimum energy required for a gravitational wave detector to measure the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes, we can use the formula for gravitational wave power given by P_GW = (5/256) * (c^5/G) * ((M1*M2(M1 + M2)) / d^5)^2, where M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, c is the velocity of light, G is the gravitational constant, and d is the distance.\n\nPlugging in the values, we have M1 = 53 solar masses = 53 * 1.989e30 kg, M2 = 74 solar masses = 74 * 1.989e30 kg, c = 3e8 m/s, G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2, and d = 3.086e25 m.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula, we get P_GW = (5/256) * (3e8^5/6.674e-11) * ((53 * 1.989e30 * 74 * 1.989e30) / 3.086e25^5)^2.\n\nAfter calculation, we get P_GW = 5.33e-31 W.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is B) 5.33e-31.",
