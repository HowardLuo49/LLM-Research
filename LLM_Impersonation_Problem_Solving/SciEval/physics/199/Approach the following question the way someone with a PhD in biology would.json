    "gpt_response": "To calculate the value of the magnetic field in a galaxy, we can use the equation for the magnetic field strength in a rotating object:\n\nB = (\u00b50 * I) / (2 * \u03c0 * r)\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field strength\n\u00b50 = magnetic constant (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 Tm/A)\nI = current (which is proportional to the rotational velocity)\nr = radius of the galaxy\n\nGiven:\nRadius of the galaxy, r = 50,000 light-years = 4.733 x 10^20 m\nRotational velocity, v = 769 km/s = 7.69 x 10^5 m/s\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the current, I:\nI = v / r\nI = 7.69 x 10^5 m/s / 4.733 x 10^20 m\nI = 1.625 x 10^-15 A\n\nNow, we can calculate the magnetic field strength, B:\nB = (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 Tm/A * 1.625 x 10^-15 A) / (2 * \u03c0 * 4.733 x 10^20 m)\nB = 1.725 x 10^-22 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field value in the rotating galaxy is approximately 1.725 x 10^-22 Tesla. \n\nComparing this to a non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field strength in the rotating galaxy is significantly weaker due to the current being based on the rotational velocity.
