    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk:\n\nB = (\u221a(2\u03c0G\u03c3) * v) / r\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field\nG = gravitational constant\n\u03c3 = surface mass density\nv = rotational velocity\nr = radius\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the surface mass density (\u03c3) of the galaxy. This can be approximated by assuming a mass-to-light ratio and using the luminosity of the galaxy. The surface mass density can vary significantly depending on the assumptions made.\n\nNext, we can substitute the given values into the formula. Assuming a suitable mass-to-light ratio and luminosity for the galaxy, we can then calculate the magnetic field.\n\nThis magnetic field will be significantly different from the magnetic field in a similar non-rotating galaxy, as the rotation of the galaxy affects the distribution of matter and changes the magnetic field strength. In a non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field would likely be much weaker due to the lack of rotation inducing currents and changing the distribution of matter. \n\nFrom the given choices, the closest option appears to be:\nC. 4134 T",
