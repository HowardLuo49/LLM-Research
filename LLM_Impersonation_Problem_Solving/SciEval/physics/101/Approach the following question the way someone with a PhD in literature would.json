The formula for the peak wavelength of black body radiation is given by Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and b is a constant (approximately equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K). \n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was completely ionized, which means it was a plasma that absorbed and emitted radiation in a black body spectrum.
