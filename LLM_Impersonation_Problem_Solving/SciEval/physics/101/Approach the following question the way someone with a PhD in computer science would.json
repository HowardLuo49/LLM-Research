    "gpt_response": "B. 5698.75 k\n\nExplanation: \nThe temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated by using Wien's displacement law for black body radiation. This law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. \n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated as follows:\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere b is Wien's displacement constant and is equal to 2.8977685 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K, and T is the temperature. \n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation corresponds to a temperature of about 2.73 K, which is given by T0 = 2.73 K. \n\nUsing the fact that the universe was completely ionized at this time, we can assume a black body spectrum for the cosmic microwave background radiation. \n\nSince the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, we can set up the following equation:\n\u03bb_max,380000 = \u03bb_max,0 * (1 + z)\n\nwhere \u03bb_max,380000 is the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation 380,000 years after the Big Bang, \u03bb_max,0 is the peak wavelength corresponding to T0 = 2.73 K, and z is the redshift factor. \n\nFrom the ratio of the temperatures, we can find the redshift factor:\nT / T0 = \u03bb_max,0 / \u03bb_max = 3800 / 1090.28\nz = 3800 / 1090.28 - 1 \u2248 2.48\n\nPlugging this redshift factor back into the first equation and solving for T gives:\nT = \u03bb_max,380000 = \u03bb_max,0 * (1 + z) = 1090.28 * (1 + 2.48) \u2248 5698.75 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5698.75 K.",
