    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to consider the redshift due to the expansion of the universe. The temperature T of the universe can be related to the current temperature T0 of 2.73 K through the formula:\n\nT = T0 / (1 + z)\n\nwhere z is the redshift. The redshift can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = a_now / a_then\n\nwhere a_now is the current scale factor of the universe and a_then is the scale factor at the time of interest. The scale factor can be related to the temperature through the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\nT = T0 / (a_now / a_then)\n\nGiven that the universe was completely ionized at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can assume that the temperature of the universe was very high at that time, making the scale factor very small compared to its current value. Therefore, we can simplify the above equation to:\n\nT = T0 * a_then / a_now\n\nThe scale factor at the time of interest can be related to the temperature using the relationship between the temperature and the energy density of radiation:\n\nT = (30 / pi^2)^(1/4) * hbar * c / k_B * a_then / a_now\n\nwhere hbar is the reduced Planck constant, c is the speed of light, and k_B is the Boltzmann constant. Substituting in the given values and solving for the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang yields:\n\nT = 5698.75 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5698.75 K",
