    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law and the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time, meaning it had a black body spectrum.\n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The peak wavelength can be calculated using the formula \u03bb_max = b/T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor the cosmic microwave background radiation with a temperature T0 = 2.73 K, the peak wavelength is \u03bb_max = 2.897 x 10^-3 / 2.73 = 1.061 x 10^-3 m or 1.061 mm.\n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, the peak wavelength corresponds to the wavelength of the recombination radiation, which is observed as the cosmic microwave background radiation today.\n\nUsing the temperature of the CMB radiation today (T0 = 2.73 K) and the observed peak wavelength of 1.061 mm, we can calculate the temperature 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula \u03bb_max = b/T. Solving for T, we get T = b/\u03bb_max = 2.897 x 10^-3 / 1.061 x 10^-3 = 2.73 * (2.897 / 1.061) = 7.45 K.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is:\n\nA. 3000.0 K",
