In this case, we can use the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) as the temperature of the object.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the CMB spectrum is found to be around 1 mm, which corresponds to a temperature of approximately 2900 K. Since the CMB has a black body spectrum, we can consider this as the effective temperature of the universe at that time.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3000.0 k",
