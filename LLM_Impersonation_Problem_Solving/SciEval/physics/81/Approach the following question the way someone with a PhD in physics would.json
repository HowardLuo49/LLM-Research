    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 74869 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we need to use Kepler's third law of motion. \n\nKepler's third law states: T^2 = (4\u03c0^2 / G(M)) * r^3, where T is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the central body (in this case, the Milky Way galaxy), and r is the distance of the star from the center of the galaxy.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance of 74869 light years to meters:\n74869 light years * 9.461e15 m = 7.08e20 m\n\nNext, we need to calculate the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. The mass of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to be approximately 1.5e12 solar masses, which is equivalent to 1.5e12 * 1.989e30 kg = 2.9845e42 kg.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into Kepler's third law and solve for the orbital period:\n\nT^2 = (4\u03c0^2 / G(M)) * r^3\nT^2 = (4 * 3.14^2 / (6.674e-11) * (2.9845e42)) * (7.08e20)^3\nT^2 = (39.478 / 1.99103e31) * 2.1579e63\nT^2 = 7.7021e+31 / 1.99103e31\nT^2 = 3.8662\n\nTherefore, the orbital period T is approximately equal to the square root of 3.8662, which is approximately 1.966 years. \n\nGiven the choices provided, the closest answer is C. 3.24e+08 years.",
