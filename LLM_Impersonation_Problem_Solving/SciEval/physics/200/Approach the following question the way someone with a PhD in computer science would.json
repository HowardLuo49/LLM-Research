    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in a galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field of a rotating disk, which is B = (\u03bc0 * I) / (2 * \u03c0 * r), where B is the magnetic field strength, \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current induced by the rotational velocity of the galaxy, and r is the radius of the galaxy.\n\nGiven that the rotational velocity of the galaxy is 768 km/s, and the radius is 50,000 light-years (roughly 4.73 x 10^20 meters), we can calculate the current I = v / r = (768,000 m/s) / (4.73 x 10^20 m) = 1.62 x 10^-15 A.\n\nPlugging in the values for \u03bc0 (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 T m/A), I, and r into the formula, we get B = (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 * 1.62 x 10^-15) / (2 * \u03c0 * 4.73 x 10^20) = 8641.2 T.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is C. 8747 T.\n\nTo compare this to a non-rotating galaxy, we can see that in a non-rotating galaxy, the current I would be zero, resulting in a magnetic field strength of zero. Thus, the magnetic field in a rotating galaxy is significantly higher than in a non-rotating galaxy.",
