    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation assuming it to be a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula for this relationship is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 953.8 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nSubstitute the given frequency into the formula:\n\n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 / 953.8 x 10^9 Hz = 3.14 x 10^-4 m = 314 \u00b5m\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature using the peak wavelength:\n\n314 x 10^-6 m = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / T\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3) / 314 x 10^-6 = 9.21 K\n\nTherefore, the calculated temperature is 9.21 K.
