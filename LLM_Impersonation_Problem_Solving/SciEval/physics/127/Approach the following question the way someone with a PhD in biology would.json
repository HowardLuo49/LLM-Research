    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of emission of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature, according to the equation \u03bb_max * T = constant.\n\nThe constant for Wien's displacement law is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m.K. Given that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 953.8 GHz (or 9.538 x 10^11 Hz), we can convert this frequency to the corresponding wavelength using the equation c = f\u03bb, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). Thus, the wavelength (\u03bb) at which the radiation peaks can be calculated as 3 x 10^8 / 9.538 x 10^11 \u2248 3.15 x 10^-4 meters.\n\nNow, we can determine the temperature of the radiation using the Wien's displacement law equation:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\nT = constant / \u03bb_max \n\nSubstituting in the values:\n\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 3.15 x 10^-4 \u2248 9.21 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer from the given choices is B. 9.21 K.",
