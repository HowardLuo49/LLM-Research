    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can first use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of thermal radiation from a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The equation relating peak wavelength (\u03bb_max) and temperature (T) is:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = 2.9 * 10^-3 m*K\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 953.8 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 * 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (953.8 * 10^9 Hz).\n\nCalculating the wavelength gives us:\n\n\u03bb = 3 * 10^8 / (953.8 * 10^9) = 3.15 * 10^-4 m\n\nNow we can substitute this wavelength into the equation along with the temperature to solve for T:\n\n(3.15 * 10^-4) * T = 2.9 * 10^-3\n\nT = 2.9 * 10^-3 / (3.15 * 10^-4) = 9.21 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 9.21 K.
