    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. \n\nThe equation for Wien's displacement law is:\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_max = peak wavelength\nb = Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m K)\nT = temperature\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 953.8 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the equation:\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb = wavelength\nc = speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nf = frequency (953.8 GHz = 953.8 x 10^9 Hz)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 / 953.8 x 10^9\n\u03bb = 3.15 x 10^-4 m or 315 \u03bcm\n\nNow we can rearrange Wien's displacement law to solve for temperature:\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 315 x 10^-6\nT = 9.2 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is closest to option B: 9.21 K.",
