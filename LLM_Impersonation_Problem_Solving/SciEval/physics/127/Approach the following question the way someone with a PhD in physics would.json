    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength of the peak emission of a blackbody is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength of the peak emission, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 953.8 GHz, we can use the relation between frequency and wavelength:\n\nc = f * \u03bb\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), f is the frequency, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nFirst, we convert the frequency from GHz to Hz:\n\nf = 953.8 GHz = 953.8 x 10^9 Hz\n\nNext, we can find the corresponding wavelength of the peak emission:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (953.8 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb \u2248 314.57 \u03bcm\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K) / (314.57 x 10^-6 m)\nT \u2248 9.21 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 9.21 K",
