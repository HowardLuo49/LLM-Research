    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object emitting the radiation. The formula for this relationship is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / \u03bd_peak = b / T\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_peak = peak wavelength\nc = speed of light\n\u03bd_peak = peak frequency\nb = Wien's displacement constant\nT = temperature\n\nGiven that \u03bd_peak = 953.8 GHz, we can convert this to units of Hz (1 GHz = 10^9 Hz) and plug into the formula:\n\n\u03bd_peak = 953.8 x 10^9 Hz\nb = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / \u03bd_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (953.8 x 10^9 Hz) = 3.14 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow, using the relationship between peak wavelength and temperature, we can solve for the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak = 2.89777 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K / 3.14 x 10^-4 m \u2248 9.21 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 9.21 K",
