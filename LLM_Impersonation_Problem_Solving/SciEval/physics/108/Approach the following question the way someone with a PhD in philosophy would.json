Calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, assuming that the universe was completely ionized at that time and that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : T0 = 2.73 k. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 2998.89 k\nB. 8560.5 k\nC. 3000.0 k\nD. 9560.98 k\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we must consider the relationship between the temperature of a black body radiator and its peak wavelength according to Wien's Law:\n\n\u03bbmax = 2.8977685 x 10^-3 / T\n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, the peak wavelength of the radiation can be calculated. The peak wavelength will correspond to a specific temperature, which will give us the temperature of the universe at that time.\n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe was approximately 3000 K. Therefore, the closest option from the given choices is C. 3000.0 k.",
