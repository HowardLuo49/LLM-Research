    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang when it was completely ionized, we can use Wien's displacement law for black body radiation. \n\nAccording to the law, the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. The peak wavelength is given by the equation:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m * K) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor the cosmic microwave background radiation, we know that the peak wavelength is around 1 mm. Therefore, we can calculate the temperature using the provided temperature of 2.73 K:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3) / 2.73 = 1.0626 x 10^-3 m = 1 mm\n\nNow, if we assume that the temperature of the universe was much higher at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can say that the temperature was approximately 1000 times higher. Therefore, the estimated temperature would be:\n\nT = T0 * 1000 = 2.73 k * 1000 = 2730 k\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is option C: 3000.0 k.",
