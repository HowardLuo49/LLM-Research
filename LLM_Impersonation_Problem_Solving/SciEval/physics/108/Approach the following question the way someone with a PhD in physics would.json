    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation corresponds to a temperature of 2.73 K. \n\nThe temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the relation:\n\n\u03bb_max1 / T1 = \u03bb_max2 / T2\n\nWhere \u03bb_max1 and \u03bb_max2 are the peak wavelengths of the radiation at the reference temperature (2.73 K) and the temperature we want to calculate, respectively, and T1 and T2 are the corresponding temperatures.\n\nGiven that the peak wavelength of the CMB radiation at 2.73 K is around 1.06 mm, we can calculate the temperature 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\n\u03bb_max1 / T0 = \u03bb_max2 / T\n1.06 mm / 2.73 K = \u03bb_max2 / T\n0.3889 mm * T = 1.06 mm\nT = 1.06 mm / 0.3889 = 2.727 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K, which is closest to the option C: 3000.0 K.",
