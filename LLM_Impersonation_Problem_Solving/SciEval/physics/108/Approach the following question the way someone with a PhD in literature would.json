    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's Law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature. The equation for Wien's Law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is the Wien displacement constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Since the universe was completely ionized at that time, the radiation emitted would have a black body spectrum. We can assume that the peak wavelength corresponds to the temperature of the universe.\n\nThe Wien displacement constant, b, is approximately equal to 2.89777 x 10^-3 m*K, or 2.89777 mm*K.\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.89777 mm*K / T\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.89777 mm*K / T0 \n\nT = 2.89777 mm*K / \u03bb_max\n\nT = 2.89777 mm*K / 1.06 mm\n\nT \u2248 2.735 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is 2.735 K, which is closest to option C: 3000.0 K.",
