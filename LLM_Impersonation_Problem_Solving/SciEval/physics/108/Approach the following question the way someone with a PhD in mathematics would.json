    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the Wien's displacement law which states that the wavelength at which the black body radiation is at its maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature. \n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_max is the peak wavelength\nb is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K)\nT is the temperature\n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at the time mentioned, the peak wavelength corresponds to the wavelength at which the universe transitioned from ionized to neutral, known as the decoupling event. This wavelength is approximately 1.063 mm.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\n1.063 x 10^-3 m = (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K) / T\n\nSolving for T:\n\nT = (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m) / (1.063 x 10^-3 m)\nT = 2.726 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.73 K, which is the closest to option C. 3000 K.",
