What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 83 and 25 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 38 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system:\n\nf = 1 / (pi * (G * (M1 + M2) * f^(2/3))\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, G is the gravitational constant, and f is the orbital frequency of the binary system. Plugging in the given values:\n\nM1 = 83 * mass of the sun = 83 * 1.989e30 kg\nM2 = 25 * mass of the sun = 25 * 1.989e30 kg\nG = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nf = 1 / 38 seconds\n\nwe can calculate the frequency. Next, to find the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula:\n\nA = (4 / R) * (G * (M1 * M2) * pi * f^2 / c^4)\n\nwhere R is the distance from the binary system to Earth, which is about 1.5e11 meters. Plugging in the values, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth.\n\nFinally, to detect these waves, we could use interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) or VIRGO (European Gravitational Observatory). If these waves are detected, it would provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes and validate Einstein's theory of general relativity. It would also open up a new field of astronomy known as gravitational wave astronomy, allowing us to study the universe in a completely new way.",
