    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by an orbiting binary system:\n\nf = (1/(2*pi)) * (G*(m1 + m2)/(c^3))^(3/2) * (m1 * m2/(m1 + m2))^0.5 * (1/a^1.5)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes, G is the gravitational constant, c is the velocity of light, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nGiven m1 = 83 solar masses = 83 * 1.989e30 kg, m2 = 25 solar masses = 25 * 1.989e30 kg, and a = (38 seconds)^2 * G * (m1 + m2)/(4*pi^2), we can plug in the values and calculate the frequency.\n\nf = (1/(2*3.14)) * (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * (83*1.989e30 kg + 25*1.989e30 kg)/(3e8 m/s)^3)^(3/2) * (83*1.989e30 kg * 25*1.989e30 kg/(83*1.989e30 kg + 25*1.989e30 kg))^0.5 * (1/((38 seconds)^2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * (83*1.989e30 kg + 25*1.989e30 kg)/(4*3.14^2)))^1.5\n\nSolving this equation gives us a frequency of 2.68e-15 Hz, which corresponds to option A.\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula:\n\nh = (4*G*c^-4/((pi^2)*d)) * (m1 * m2/(m1 + m2)) * (f/c^3)^(2/3)\n\nwhere d is the distance between Earth and the binary system.
