    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula relating peak wavelength and temperature is given by \u03bb_max = c / f_max, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, c is the speed of light, and f_max is the frequency at which the radiation peaks.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 975.5 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using f = c / \u03bb, where f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength. Solving for \u03bb, we get:\n\n975.5 GHz = c / \u03bb\n\u03bb = c / (975.5 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb = 3.07 mm\n\nNow, to calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use the relationship T = b / \u03bb_max, where T is the temperature, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K), and \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength. Substituting in the values, we get:\n\nT = (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m*K) / (3.07 x 10^-3 m)\nT = 0.945 K\n\nTherefore, the corresponding temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 0.945 K. \n\nThe closest option from the given choices is: C. 9.42 K.",
