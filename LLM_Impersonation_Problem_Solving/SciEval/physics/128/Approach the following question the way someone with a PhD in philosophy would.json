    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 m\u00b7K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 975.5 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the relation \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s). This gives us:\n\n\u03bb = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s / (975.5 \u00d7 10^9 Hz) = 0.307 meters\n\nNow we can use this wavelength to find the temperature of the radiation:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max = 2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 m\u00b7K / 0.307 m = 9.44 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is closest to:\n\nC. 9.42 K",
