    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation curve is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and the constant is equal to approximately 2.9 mm*k.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 975.5 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency (975.5 GHz = 975.5 x 10^9 Hz).\n\n\u03bb_peak = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (975.5 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.3074 mm\n\nNow we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\n0.3074 mm * T = 2.9 mm*k\nT = 2.9 mm*k / 0.3074 mm\nT = 9.42 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 9.42 K. The closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 9.42 K",
