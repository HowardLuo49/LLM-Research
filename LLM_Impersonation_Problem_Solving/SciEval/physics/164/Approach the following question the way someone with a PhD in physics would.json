    "gpt_response": "To find the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula for the gravitational wave frequency:\n\nf = (c^3 / (G * (M1 + M2))) * (\\pi / P)^{1/3}\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the masses of the two black holes, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and P is the orbital period.\n\nGiven that M1 = 63 solar masses and M2 = 33 solar masses, we can convert these to kilograms using the conversion factor provided:\n\nM1 = 63 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.253e32 kg\nM2 = 33 * 1.989e30 kg = 6.57e31 kg\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula along with the other constants:\n\nf = (3e8^3 / (6.674e-11 * (1.253e32 + 6.57e31))) * (\\pi / 92)^{1/3}\nf = (27e24 / (6.674e-11 * 1.91e32)) * (\\pi / 92)^{1/3}\nf = 4.26e-17 * (\\pi / 92)^{1/3}\nf = 2.97e-15 Hz\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the black holes is 2.97e-15 Hz, which is closest to option C.\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula for the amplitude of gravitational waves:\n\nh = (4G / (c^4)) * (\\pi^{2/3} / f^{2/3}) * (M1 * M2 / (M1 + M2)) * (1 / D)\n\nwhere D is the distance to the source. Given that we are detecting the waves on Earth, D can be approximated as 1 light year = 9.461e15 m.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11 / 3e8^4) * (\\pi^{2/3} / (2.97e-15)^{2/3}) * (1.253e32 * 6.57e31 / (1.253e32 + 6.57e31)) * (1 / 9.461e15)\nh = 4.6e-15\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth is approximately 4.6e-15, which is closest to option B.\n\nTo detect these gravitational waves, we would need a sensitive gravitational wave detector such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) or the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO). Detecting these waves would provide further evidence for the existence of black holes and help us better understand the behavior of celestial bodies in extreme environments. It would also confirm the predictions of general relativity and open up new possibilities for studying the universe.",
