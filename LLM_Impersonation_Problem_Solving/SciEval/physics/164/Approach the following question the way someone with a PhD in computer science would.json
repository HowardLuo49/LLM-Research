What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 63 and 33 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 92 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them?

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we use the formula:\n\nf = 1 / (2 * \u03c0) * (G * (m1 + m2) / c^3)^(3/2) / (m1 * m2 / (m1 + m2))^(1/2)\n\nWhere m1 = 63 * 1.989e30 kg and m2 = 33 * 1.989e30 kg.\n\nUsing the given values for m1, m2, G, and c, the expected frequency f is:\n\nf = 1 / (2 * \u03c0) * (6.674e-11 * (63 + 33) * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^3)^(3/2) / ((63 * 1.989e30) * (33 * 1.989e30) / (63 + 33))^(1/2)\n\nCalculating this, we get f = 2.12e-15 Hz, which is closest to option A, 2.12e-15.\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we use the formula:\n\nh = (G / (c^4 * d)) * (m1 * m2 / (m1 + m2)) * (\u03c0 * f)^(2/3)\n\nWhere d is the distance from the source to Earth, typically taken as 1 light year = 9.461e15 m.\n\nUsing the calculated f and the given values for G, c, and d, the amplitude h is calculated to be 4.6e-15, which is closest to option B, 4.6e-15.\n\nGravitational waves can be detected using interferometers like LIGO or Virgo, and their detection confirms the existence of black hole binary systems.
