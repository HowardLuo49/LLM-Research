    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole. It represents the radius at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, such that anything crossing this radius falls into the black hole and cannot escape. The formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius is given by:\n\nSchwarzschild radius (rs) = 2 * G * mass / c^2\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 5 solar masses, we can substitute the values into the formula:\n\nmass = 5 * 1.989e30 kg\nG = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nrs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 5 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nrs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 9.945e30 / 9e16\nrs = 1.3348e20 / 9e16\nrs = 14.87 km\n\nConverting this to meters, we get rs = 14787 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 14750 m",
