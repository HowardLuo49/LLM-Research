Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 5 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, named after Karl Schwarzschild, is the radius below which the gravitational attraction of a massive body is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is defined as Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven the mass of the black hole as 5 solar masses, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius using the formula:\nRs = 2 * G * (5 * 1.989e30) / c^2\n\nPlugging in the values of G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2, solar mass = 1.989e30 kg, and c = 3e8 m/s, we get:\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * (5 * 1.989e30) / (3e8)^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 9.945e30 / 9e16\nRs = 1.3348e20 / 9e16\nRs = 1.4831e4 meters\n\nTherefore, the closest option is B. 14750 m.",
