    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation distribution is proportional to the inverse of the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 771.2 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the equation c = \u03bbf, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). Therefore, the wavelength of the peak frequency is \u03bb = c/f = 3 x 10^8 m/s / 771.2 x 10^9 Hz = 0.38 mm.\n\nUsing Wien's displacement law, we can find the temperature T of the blackbody radiation distribution as T = b/\u03bb_peak, where b is the Wien displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K). Substituting in the values, we get T = 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K / 0.38 x 10^-3 m = 7.63 K.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is:\nC. 7.45 K",
