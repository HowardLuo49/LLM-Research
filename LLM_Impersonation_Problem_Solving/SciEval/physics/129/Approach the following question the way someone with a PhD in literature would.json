    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation assuming it to be a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 771.2 GHz, we can use the relationship between frequency and wavelength for electromagnetic radiation:\n\nc = \u03bb * f\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for wavelength, we get:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nSubstituting the values given:\n\n\u03bb = (3.00 x 10^8 m/s) / (771.2 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb \u2248 0.389 x 10^-3 m \u2248 389.0 \u03bcm\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / 389.0 x 10^-6 m\nT \u2248 7.45 K\n\nTherefore, the calculated temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.45 K.
