    "gpt_response": "To start, we can use Wien's Law to calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nThe formula for Wien's Law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_peak\n\nSubstitute the given peak frequency of 771.2 GHz (7.71 x 10^11 Hz) into the formula for wavelength:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / f_peak \n\nwhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s) and f_peak is the peak frequency.\n\n\u03bb_peak = 3 x 10^8 / 7.71 x 10^11 \n\u03bb_peak = 3.89 x 10^-4 m or 389 nm\n\nNow, plug this calculated wavelength into Wien's Law formula:\n\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 3.89 x 10^-4\nT \u2248 7.45 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.45 K, which is closest to option C.",
