    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a blackbody at thermal equilibrium, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of radiation is inversely proportional to the temperature. The law is given by the equation:\n\n\u03bb_max = (c / f_max) = (b / T)\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, c is the speed of light, f_max is the frequency of the radiation peak, b is the Wien displacement constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 771.2 GHz (7.712 x 10^11 Hz), we can rearrange the equation to solve for T:\n\nT = b / (c / f_max)\nT = 2.8977729 x 10^-3 m K / (3 x 10^8 m/s / 7.712 x 10^11 Hz)\nT \u2248 7.45 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.45 Kelvin.
