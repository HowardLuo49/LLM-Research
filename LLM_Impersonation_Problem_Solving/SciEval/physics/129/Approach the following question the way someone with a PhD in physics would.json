    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for this relationship is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = b\n\nWhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and b is the Wien constant equal to approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m K.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 771.2 GHz, we can calculate the corresponding wavelength using the formula:\n\nc = \u03bb*f \n\nWhere c is the speed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Substituting in the given values, we find:\n\n\u03bb = c / f = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (771.2 x 10^9 Hz) = 3.89 x 10^-4 m = 389 \u03bcm\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature using Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = b\nT = b / \u03bb_peak = 2.897 x 10^-3 m K / 389 x 10^-6 m = 7.45 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 7.45 K",
