    "gpt_response": "To find the magnetic field at the center of the square loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire. The magnetic field at the center of a loop can be found by summing the magnetic fields produced by each of the four sides of the loop. Since the loop is symmetrical, the magnetic fields produced by opposite sides will cancel out, leaving only the contributions from two adjacent sides.\n\nThe magnetic field due to a current-carrying wire is given by B = (\u03bc0 * I) / (2\u03c0r), where \u03bc0 is the magnetic constant, I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nFor a square loop of side length 7.0 m and current 2 A, the distance from the center of the loop to the wire is r = 3.5 m (half the side length). Therefore, the magnetic field at the center of the loop due to one side of the loop is B = (\u03bc0 * I) / (2\u03c0 * 3.5).\n\nSince there are two sides contributing to the magnetic field at the center, we need to add the magnetic fields from both sides. The total magnetic field at the center of the loop is then B_total = 2 * (\u03bc0 * I) / (2\u03c0 * 3.5).\n\nNow, substitute the given values for \u03bc0 and I into the equation, so B_total = 2 * (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 2) / (2\u03c0 * 3.5) = 1.6 * 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nD. 1.6 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
