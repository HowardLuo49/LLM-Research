    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which relates the temperature of a black body to the peak wavelength of its emitted radiation. \n\nWe know that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, so we can use the fact that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is given by \u03bbmax = 2.898/T. \n\nAt 380,000 years, the temperature of the universe can be calculated using the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (T0 = 2.73 k) and the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time. The situation after recombination is characterized by the temperature of the dominant radiation being determined by the temperature of the ~3,000 K charged gas relative to the CMB. This implies that the temperature of the universe at that time was around 3,000 K.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3000.0 k",
