    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for a black body radiation spectrum. This law states that the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. \n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 1.06 mm. Using Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere b is Wien's displacement constant (2.897 x 10^-3 m K) and T is the temperature. Plugging in the values:\n\n1.06 x 10^-3 m = 2.897 x 10^-3 m K / T\n\nT = 2.73 / 1.06 = 2.57 K\n\nThis is the peak temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This corresponds to the average temperature of the universe at that time. Therefore, the closest choice is:\n\nD. 2957.84 K\n\nThis choice is closest to the calculated temperature of approximately 2570 K.",
