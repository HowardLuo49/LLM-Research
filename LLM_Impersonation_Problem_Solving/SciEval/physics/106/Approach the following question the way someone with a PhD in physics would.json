    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for black body radiation. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bbmax = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, b is the Wien constant (2.8977729 x 10^-3 m * K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at that time, the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is around 1.06 mm, corresponding to a temperature of around 3000 K (using T0 = 2.73 K as reference).\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3000.0 K",
