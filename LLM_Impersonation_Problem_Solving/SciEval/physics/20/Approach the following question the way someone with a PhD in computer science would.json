    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we first need to determine the circumference of the galactic halo. Given that the average radius is 48038 light-years, we can calculate the circumference using the formula: \n\nCircumference = 2 * \u03c0 * radius\n\nC = 2 * 3.14 * 48038 light-years\n\nNext, we convert this circumference from light-years to meters using the conversion factor provided:\n\n1 light-year = 9.461e15 meters\n\nC = 2 * 3.14 * 48038 * 9.461e15 meters\n\nNow, we can calculate the linear velocity of the halo by taking into account the velocity of light:\n\nV = 2 * \u03c0 * radius / rotational period\n\nV = (2 * 3.14 * 48038 * 9.461e15) / rotational period\n\nNow, let's express the velocity in terms of light years and years:\n\nV = (2 * 3.14 * 48038) * 9.461e15 / rotational period = 3.8e20 / rotational period m/s\n\nFinally, we can set the linear velocity to be equal to the speed of light in a circular orbit:\n\n3e8 = 3.8e20 / rotational period m/s\n\nBy solving for the rotational period, we get:\n\nrotational period = 3.8e20 / 3e8 seconds = 1.27e13 seconds\n\nConverting this to years, we get:\nrotational period = 4.03e+05 years\n\nSince none of the given choices match exactly with 4.03e+05 years, the closest answer would be option D, 4.12e+08 years.",
