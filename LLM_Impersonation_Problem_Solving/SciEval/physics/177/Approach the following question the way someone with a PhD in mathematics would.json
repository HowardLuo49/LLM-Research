Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light. This is the point at which the gravitational attraction due to the mass becomes so strong that not even light can escape, creating a black hole.\n\nThe formula for the Schwarzschild radius is given by:\n\nR = 2GM / c^2\n\nwhere R is the Schwarzschild radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values given:\n\nG = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nM = 7 solar masses = 7 * 1.989e30 kg\nc = 3e8 m/s\n\nR = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 7 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nR \u2248 14907 m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 14907 m.",
