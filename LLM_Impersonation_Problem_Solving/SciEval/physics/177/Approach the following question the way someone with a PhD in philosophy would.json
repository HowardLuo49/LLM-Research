Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole, named after the German physicist Karl Schwarzschild. It represents the radius at which the gravitational pull of a black hole becomes so strong that not even light can escape from it, leading to the formation of an event horizon.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 7 solar masses, we can use the formula:\n\nSchwarzschild radius (r_s) = 2GM / c^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nr_s = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 7 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\n\nr_s = 1864126.2988 / 9e16\n\nr_s = 0.206569 m\n\nTherefore, the closest option is:\n\nB. 20649 m",
