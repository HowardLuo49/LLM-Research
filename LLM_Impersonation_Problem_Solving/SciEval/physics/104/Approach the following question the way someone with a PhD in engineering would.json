    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = (b / T)\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is a constant (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nSince we know that the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is 1.06 mm, we can calculate the temperature at that time using the formula above:\n\n1.06 x 10^-3 m = (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K) / T\n\nT = 2.897 / 1.06 = 2.734 k\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2.734 k, which is closest to option C: 3000.0 k.",
