    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to consider the relationship between the temperature of a black body radiator and its peak wavelength. The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the radiator.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated using Wien's Law:\n\u03bbmax = b / T\nwhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (2.8977685 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is known to be around 1.06 mm. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n1.06 x 10^-3 m = b / T\nSolving for T, we get:\nT = b / (1.06 x 10^-3 m)\nT = 2937.67351 K\n\nTherefore, based on the calculations, the correct answer is closest to option C. 3000.0 K.",
