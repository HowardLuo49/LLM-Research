    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and wavelength for a black body spectrum. The formula for this relationship is known as Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength of maximum intensity (peak wavelength) and T is the temperature. We can rearrange this formula to:\n\nT = constant / \u03bb_max\n\nWe also know that for the cosmic microwave background radiation, the peak wavelength corresponds to the temperature T0 = 2.73 K. Therefore, we can write:\n\nT0 = constant / \u03bb_max\n\nSolving for the constant, we get:\n\nconstant = T0 * \u03bb_max\n\nNext, we need to consider the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has a peak wavelength in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The peak wavelength for this radiation can be calculated using Wien's displacement law:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T0\n\nWhere b is Wien's displacement constant. Substituting the known values, we get:\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 x 10^-3 m K / 2.73 K \u2248 1.062 x 10^-3 m\n\nNow we can calculate the constant:\n\nconstant = 2.73 K * 1.062 x 10^-3 m \u2248 2.897 x 10^-3 m K\n\nFinally, we can use this constant to calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\nT = constant / \u03bb_max = 2.897 x 10^-3 m K / 1.062 x 10^-3 m \u2248 2.73 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nC. 3000.0 K",
