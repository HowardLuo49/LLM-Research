    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law along with the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time.\n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The equation is as follows:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the universe was completely ionized, we can assume that the wavelength of the peak of the cosmic microwave background radiation is in the visible range (around 500nm).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n500 x 10^-9 m = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / T\n\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3 m*K) / 500 x 10^-9 m\nT = 5.796 K\n\nThis temperature corresponds to the peak of the black body spectrum. The actual temperature of the universe would be slightly higher than this value. Using the fact that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, we can estimate the temperature by dividing T0 (2.73 K) by 5.796 K and multiplying by the peak temperature.\n\nActual temperature = (2.73 K / 5.796 K) * 5.796 K\nActual temperature = 2.73 K\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is:\n\nB. 3295.01 K",
