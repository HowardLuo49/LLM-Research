    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. Given that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, we can use this law to determine the temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength (\u03bb) of the radiation at that time can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03bb_peak = c / T\n\nWhere c is the speed of light and T is the temperature. At that time, the radiation would have been recombined, meaning the temperature was around 3000K. \n\nSince the radiation is black body radiation, we can use the fact that the peak wavelength is related to the temperature through the Wien displacement law, which states that:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = constant\n\nUsing the temperature at the time (3000K) and the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (T0 = 2.73K), we can set up the following equation:\n\n\u03bb_peak(3000) = \u03bb_peak(T0)\n\nSolving for \u03bb_peak gives:\n\n\u03bb_peak = T0 / 3000\n\nSubstituting T0 = 2.73K, we get:\n\n\u03bb_peak = 2.73 / 3000 = 0.00091 m\n\nNow, we can find the temperature by rearranging the formula for peak wavelength in terms of temperature:\n\nT = c / \u03bb_peak\n\nSubstitute \u03bb_peak = 0.00091 m and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s, we get:\n\nT = 3 x 10^8 / 0.00091 \u2248 3296.70 K\n\nAmong the choices, B. 3295.01 K is the closest to the correct answer.",
