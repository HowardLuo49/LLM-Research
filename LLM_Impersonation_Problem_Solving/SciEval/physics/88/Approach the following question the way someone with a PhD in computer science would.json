What is the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 17762 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, assuming a circular orbit around the galactic center? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations :\\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s ;light year = 9.461e15 m.
