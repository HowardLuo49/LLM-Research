    "gpt_response": "Let's start by calculating the rest energy of the white dwarf star using Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2. \n\nThe rest energy (E) of the white dwarf is given by E = 4.5 * 1.989e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 8.01e46 J.\n\nIn a Type Ia supernova explosion, the entire mass of the white dwarf is converted into energy. This energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the explosion.\n\nTherefore, the kinetic energy released in the Type Ia supernova explosion is equal to the rest energy of the white dwarf, which is approximately 8.01e46 J.\n\nThe closest answer choice to this calculated value is:\n\nB. 8.06e+47 J",
