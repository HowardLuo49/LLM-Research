What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (4.5solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the white dwarf star and v is the velocity of the explosion, which we will assume is the speed of light (c).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star from solar masses to kilograms:\n4.5 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg = 8.95e30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy:\nKE = (1/2)(8.95e30 kg)(3e8 m/s)^2\nKE = 4.475e30 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nKE = 4.0275e47 kg m^2/s^2\n\nFinally, we convert the units to joules by recognizing that 1 kg m^2/s^2 is equivalent to 1 joule:\nKE = 4.0275e47 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is:\nB. 4.03e+47 J",
