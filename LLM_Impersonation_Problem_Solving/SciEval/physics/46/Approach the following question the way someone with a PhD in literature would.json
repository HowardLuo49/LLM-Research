    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we must first consider the energy of the cosmic ray particle in electronvolts (eV) and then convert it to joules since acceleration is given in terms of meters per second squared. The energy of the cosmic ray particle is given as 6 TeV, which is equivalent to 6 x 10^12 eV. \n\nUsing the formula for kinetic energy, E = 0.5 * m * v^2, where E is the energy of the particle, m is its mass (which can be approximated to be the mass of a proton), and v is the velocity of the particle. We can rearrange this formula to solve for velocity:\n\nv = sqrt(2E / m)\n\nGiven that the velocity of the cosmic ray particle is very close to the speed of light, we can approximate the velocity as c = 3 x 10^8 m/s. Substituting the values, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2 * 6 x 10^12 eV * 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV / mass_of_proton)\n\nThe magnetic field strength at the supernova remnant shock wave is given as 299 microgauss, which is equivalent to 299 x 10^-6 T.\n\nThe Lorentz force experienced by a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the equation F = q * v * B, where F is the force, q is the charge of the particle, v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength.
