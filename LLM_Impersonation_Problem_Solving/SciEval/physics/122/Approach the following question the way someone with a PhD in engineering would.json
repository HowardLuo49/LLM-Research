    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 906.6 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\u03bb = 3 x 10^8 / 906.6 x 10^9\n\u03bb = 0.33 mm\n\nNow, using Wien's displacement law, we can solve for T:\n\n0.33 x 10^-3 = (2.898 x 10^-3) / T\nT = (2.898 x 10^-3) / 0.33 x 10^-3\nT = 8.79 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 8.79 K. From the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nD. 8.76 K",
