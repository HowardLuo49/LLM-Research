    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation curve is inversely proportional to its temperature. \n\nFirst, we convert the frequency of the radiation to wavelength using the formula: wavelength = speed of light / frequency. \nWavelength = 3 x 10^8 m/s  / 906.6 x 10^9 Hz = 3.31 x 10^-4 m \n\nNext, we use Wien's displacement law in the form \u03bb_peak * T = constant, where the constant is approximately 2.897 x 10^-3 m*K. \nRearranging the equation gives T = constant / \u03bb_peak = (2.897 x 10^-3 m*K) / 3.31 x 10^-4 m = 8.75 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer would be option D, 8.76 K.",
