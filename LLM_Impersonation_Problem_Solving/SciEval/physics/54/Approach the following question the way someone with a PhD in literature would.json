    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases over time as the universe expands.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.5 Kelvin, we can use the relationship between temperature and time to estimate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This relationship is based on the fact that the temperature decreases inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe.\n\nGiven that the universe is roughly 13.8 billion years old, we can calculate the scale factor at an age of 380,000 years and use it to estimate the temperature. \n\nUsing the ratio of the scale factors at 380,000 years and the present day, we can estimate that the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 3766.4 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer from the given choices is:\n\nC. 3766.4 kelvin",
