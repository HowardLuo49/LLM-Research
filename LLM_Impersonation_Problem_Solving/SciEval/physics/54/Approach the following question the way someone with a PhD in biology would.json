    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The temperature of the universe decreases over time due to its expansion, so we can assume that the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be higher than the present-day temperature of approximately 1.5 Kelvin.\n\nOne way to estimate the temperature at any given age after the Big Bang is to use the formula T = T0 * (1 + z), where T is the temperature of the universe at a given age, T0 is the present-day temperature, and z is the redshift factor given by z = a0/a - 1, where a0 is the scale factor at present and a is the scale factor at the desired age after the Big Bang.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The redshift factor z can be calculated using the scale factor for an age of 380,000 years, which is approximately 0.0012 (assuming a present-day scale factor of 1). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nT = 1.5 * (1 + 0.0012) = 1.5 * 1.0012 = 1.502 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is 1651.5 Kelvin (option D).",
