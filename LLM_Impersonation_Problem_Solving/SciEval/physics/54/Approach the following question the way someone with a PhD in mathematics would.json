    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases with the expansion of the universe. The relationship between the temperature and the age of the universe is given by the formula T = To*(1+z), where To is the present-day temperature of the CMB radiation (1.5 K), and z is the redshift factor.\n\nThe redshift factor can be calculated using the formula z = 1/(1 + t/t0) - 1, where t is the age of the universe (380,000 years) and t0 is the present age of the universe. We can assume the present age of the universe to be approximately 13.8 billion years.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get z = 1/(1 + 380,000/13,800,000,000) - 1 \u2248 1/(1 + 0.0000275) - 1 \u2248 1/1.0000275 - 1 \u2248 0.0009725. \n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature at an age of 380,000 years:\n\nT = 1.5 K * (1 + 0.0009725) \u2248 1.5 K * 1.0009725 \u2248 1.5015 K\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nA. 3818.9 kelvin",
