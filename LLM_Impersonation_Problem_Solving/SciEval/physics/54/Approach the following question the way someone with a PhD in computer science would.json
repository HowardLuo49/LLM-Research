    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the fact that the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) has a present-day temperature of approximately 2.7 Kelvin, not 1.5 Kelvin as stated in the question. \n\nThe temperature of the CMB decreases with time as the universe expands according to the equation T = To * (1 + z), where T is the temperature at some time, To is the present-day temperature (2.7 Kelvin), and z is the redshift. \n\nTo find the redshift at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we use the formula z = (1 + z_recombination)/(1 + z_now) - 1, where z_recombination is the redshift at recombination (around 1100) and z_now is the present-day redshift (0). Plugging in the values, we get z = (1 + 1100)/(1 + 0) - 1 = 1100. \n\nNow we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula T = 2.7 Kelvin * (1 + 1100) = 3000 Kelvin. \n\nThe option closest to the correct answer is C. 3766.4 Kelvin.",
