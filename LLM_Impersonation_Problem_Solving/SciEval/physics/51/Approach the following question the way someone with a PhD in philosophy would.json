    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can utilize the concept of cosmological redshift. The cosmic microwave background radiation was emitted when the universe was in a much hotter state, and it has cooled down over time due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation at different times can be expressed as:\n\nT_proportional_to (1 + z)\n\nWhere T is the temperature of the radiation and z is the redshift. The redshift z can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (T_now / T_then)\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is 4.9 Kelvin, we can plug in the values to find the redshift at an age of 380,000 years:\n\n1 + z = (4.9 / T_then) = (4.9 / T_then)\n\nSolving for T_then gives:\n\nT_then = 4.9 / (1 + z) = 4.9 / (1 + z)\n\nSubstituting the redshift value into the equation, we can find the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. \n\nThe closest option from the given choices is:\n\nA. 5394.9 kelvin",
