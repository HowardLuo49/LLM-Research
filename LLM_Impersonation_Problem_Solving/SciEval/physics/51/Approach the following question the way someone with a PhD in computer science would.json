Calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, given that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a present-day temperature of approximately 4.9 Kelvin. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 5394.9 kelvin\nB. 9921.4 kelvin\nC. 8831.4 kelvin\nD. 7694.6 kelvin\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "The temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe. The scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the relationship between the age of the universe and the scale factor. From there, the temperature at that age can be determined.\n\nThe correct answer based on calculations would be:\n\nC. 8831.4 kelvin",
