    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The temperature of the universe at any given time can be related to its temperature today through the formula:\n\nT_final = T_initial / (1 + z)\n\nwhere T_final is the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, T_initial is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (4.9 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor.\n\nThe redshift factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (1 + z_start) * (T_final / T_initial)\n\nFrom cosmological models, we know that the redshift of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately z_start = 1089.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n1 + z = (1 + 1089) * (T_final / 4.9)\n\nSolving for T_final:\n\nT_final = 4.9 * (1 + 1089) / (1 + 1089) = 5394.9 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is A. 5394.9 Kelvin.",
