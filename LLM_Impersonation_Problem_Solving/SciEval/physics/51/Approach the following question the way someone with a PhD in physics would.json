The peak wavelength can be calculated as:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / T\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / 4.9 K\n\u03bb_max = 0.590 m\n\nNext, we can calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang by using the same formula with the new peak wavelength:\n\nT_universe = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / \u03bb_max\nT_universe = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / 0.59 m\nT_universe = 4915.25 Kelvin\n\nFrom the given choices, the closest answer to 4915.25 Kelvin is:\n\nA. 5394.9 kelvin",
