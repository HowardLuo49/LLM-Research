    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we need to use the formula for kinetic energy:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nGiven that the entire mass of the white dwarf star (7.7 solar masses) is converted into energy, we can calculate the total energy released using Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, and then equate it to the kinetic energy in the explosion.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total energy released:\n\nTotal energy released = mass * (c^2)\n= 7.7 * (1.989e30 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2\n= 7.7 * 1.989e30 * 9e16\n= 1.3464166e47 J\n\nSince we are assuming that all of this energy is released as kinetic energy in the explosion, the kinetic energy released in the type Ia supernova explosion would also be 1.3464166e47 J.\n\nThe option closest to this value is:\n\nC. 7.82e+48 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 7.82e+48 J.",
