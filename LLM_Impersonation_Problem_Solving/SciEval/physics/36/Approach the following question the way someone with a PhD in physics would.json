    "gpt_response": "To calculate the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, we can use the following formula:\n\nEmax = q * B * L\n\nWhere Emax is the maximum energy, q is the elementary charge, B is the magnetic field strength, and L is the characteristic length scale over which the diffusion occurs.
