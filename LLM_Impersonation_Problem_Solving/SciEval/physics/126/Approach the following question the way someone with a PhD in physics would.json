    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's law which relates the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiator to its temperature. The formula is \u03bb_max = b / T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is the Wien displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m K), and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 431.2 GHz, we can use the relation c = \u03bb * f, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Rearranging gives us \u03bb = c / f.\n\nSubstitute the given frequency into the equation, \u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (431.2 x 10^9 Hz), we get \u03bb \u2248 0.696 mm = 696 \u03bcm.\n\nNext, use the peak wavelength to calculate the temperature, T = b / \u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / (696 x 10^-6 m) \u2248 4.17 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer from the given choices is C. 4.17 K.",
