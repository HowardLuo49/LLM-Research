    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_max is the peak wavelength,\nb is Wien's displacement constant (approximately equal to 2898 \u03bcm*K),\nT is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 431.2 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the relationship between the speed of light, frequency, and wavelength:\n\nc = \u03bb * f\n\nRearranging this formula to solve for wavelength:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (431.2 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb = 6.95 x 10^-4 m\n\nNow we can find the temperature using Wien's displacement law:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT = 2898 / 6.95 x 10^-4\nT = 4.17 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 4.17 K.",
