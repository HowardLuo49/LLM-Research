    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation has decreased over time due to the expansion of the universe, which causes the wavelength of the radiation to stretch and the temperature to drop accordingly.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature of the CMB radiation at different times can be described by the formula:\n\nT_final = T_initial / (1 + z)\n\nWhere T_final is the temperature of the CMB radiation at a certain time (380,000 years after the Big Bang in this case), T_initial is the present-day temperature of the CMB radiation (6.9 K), and z is the redshift factor.\n\nThe redshift factor can be calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (a_initial / a_final) - 1\n\nWhere a_initial is the scale factor of the universe at the present time, and a_final is the scale factor of the universe at the time of interest. The scale factor of the universe is proportional to the size of the universe, and it is related to the age of the universe through the equation a = t^(2/3), where t is the age of the universe.\n\nBy plugging in the appropriate values and performing the calculations, the temperature of the CMB radiation at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 7596.9 Kelvin, which is closest to option C.",
