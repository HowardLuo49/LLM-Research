    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift. The cosmic microwave background radiation has a present-day temperature of 6.9 Kelvin, which corresponds to a redshift of z~1100. The temperature of the universe can be calculated using the formula:\n\nT_universe = T_CMB * (1 + z)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nT_universe = 6.9 * (1 + 1100) = 6.9 * 1101 = 7596.9 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 7596.9 kelvin",
