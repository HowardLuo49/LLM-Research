    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The relationship between the temperature of the radiation at different times can be characterized by the formula T(t) = T0 / (1 + z), where T(t) is the temperature at time t, T0 is the present-day temperature, and z is the redshift.\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature is approximately 6.9 Kelvin, we can plug in the values for T0 = 6.9 and t = 380,000 years into the formula. However, we also need to calculate the redshift at that time using the relation, 1 + z = (1 + zf) / (1 + zi), where zf is the final redshift (which is 0 for present-day) and zi is the initial redshift (which would be very high for early universe times).\n\nAssuming a value of zi \u2248 1000 (as an approximation for early times after the Big Bang), we can calculate z = 1 / (1 + 380,000 years) * (1 + 1000) - 1.\n\nSubstitute the calculated redshift value into the formula T(t) = T0 / (1 + z) to find the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the closest option to the correct answer for the temperature at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be:\n\nC. 7596.9 Kelvin.",
