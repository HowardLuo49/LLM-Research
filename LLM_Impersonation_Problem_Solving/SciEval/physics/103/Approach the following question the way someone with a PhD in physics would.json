    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to consider the fact that the universe was completely ionized at that time. This means that the photons in the universe would have been interacting strongly with the ionized plasma, creating a black body spectrum. \n\nThe temperature of the universe at any given time can be determined using Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength of the black body spectrum to the temperature of the radiation. The formula for Wien's Law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, 2.898 x 10^-3 m K is a constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nWe know that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a peak wavelength of about 1 mm, which corresponds to a temperature of about 3000K. This means that the temperature of the universe at that time would be approximately 3000K.\n\nThe closest option from the given choices to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3000.0 k",
