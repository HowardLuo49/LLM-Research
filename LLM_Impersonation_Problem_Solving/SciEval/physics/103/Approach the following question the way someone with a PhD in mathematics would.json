    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of radiation from a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is 1.06 mm, which corresponds to a temperature of 2.73 K. Therefore, we can use this information to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nWe can use the formula \u03bb_max = (2.90 * 10^6 nm * K) / T to solve for the temperature T, where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength of the radiation.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we have:\n\n1.06 mm = (2.90 * 10^6 nm * K) / T\nT = (2.90 * 10^6 nm * K) / 1.06 mm\nT = 2730 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is 2730 K.\n\nThe closest option to this calculated temperature is:\n\nC. 4075.94 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4075.94 K.",
