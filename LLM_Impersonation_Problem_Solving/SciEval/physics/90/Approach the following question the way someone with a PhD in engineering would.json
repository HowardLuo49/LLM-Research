    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of a star at a distance of 72826 light years from the center of the Milky Way, we can use Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. The formula for orbital period is:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(a^3 / (G * M))\n\nWhere:\nT = Orbital period\n\u03c0 = 3.14\na = Distance from the center of the galaxy = 72826 light years * 9.461e15 m (1 light year)\nG = Gravitational constant = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2\nM = Mass of the Milky Way galaxy\nThe mass of the Milky Way galaxy can be approximated by the mass of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, which is around 4.31e6 solar masses. Therefore, the mass of the Milky Way galaxy (M) = 4.31e6 * 1.989e30 kg (mass of the Sun)\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * sqrt((72826 * 9.461e15)^3 / (6.674e-11 * 4.31e6 * 1.989e30))\n\nCalculating this gives an orbital period of approximately 2.6e+08 years. Therefore, the closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 2.6e+08 years",
