    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we must first consider the concept of cosmological redshift. As the universe expands, the wavelength of photons traveling through space gets stretched, leading to a decrease in their temperature. \n\nThe formula to calculate the temperature of the universe at a certain age after the Big Bang is given by:\n\nT = T_now * (1 + z)\n\nwhere T is the temperature at the desired age, T_now is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (5.9 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor. \n\nThe redshift factor can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n1 + z = 1 / (1 + a)\n\nwhere a is the scale factor of the universe at the desired age. The scale factor a can be calculated using the formula:\n\na = (age of universe at desired age) / (age of universe now)\n\nGiven that the age of the universe now is approximately 13.8 billion years, we can calculate the age of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. \n\nUsing the calculated scale factor a, we find the redshift factor (1+z) and then substitute it back into the temperature equation to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is B. 6102.6 kelvin.",
