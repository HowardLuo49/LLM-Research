    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the relationship between the temperature of the universe and the age of the universe. The temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the age of the universe according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nThe formula for the temperature of the universe at a given age is:\nT = To / (1 + z),\nwhere T is the temperature at the age of interest, To is the present-day temperature of the CMB radiation (5.9 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor which can be calculated as the ratio of the scale factor at the age of interest to the present-day scale factor.\n\nGiven that the redshift factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 1090, we can plug in the values into the formula to find the temperature at that time:\nT = 5.9 Kelvin / (1 + 1090)\nT = 5.9 Kelvin / 1091\nT \u2248 0.00542 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the correct choice closest to the calculated temperature is option A. 3541.2 Kelvin.",
