    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of redshift. The temperature of the universe at any given time is related to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) at that time by the formula T = To*(1+z), where T is the temperature at the desired time, To is the temperature of the CMB today (5.9 K), and z is the redshift factor.\n\nThe redshift factor z is given by z = (1 + z_1)/(1 + z_2), where z_1 is the current redshift (0) and z_2 is the redshift at the desired time. The redshift at a certain time t after the Big Bang is related to that time by z = sqrt((1 + t_0)/(t + t_0)) - 1, where t_0 is the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years) in appropriate units.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get z = sqrt((1 + 13.8 billion years)/(380,000 years + 13.8 billion years)) - 1. Solving this equation gives us a redshift factor of approximately 1089.\n\nNow we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang: T = 5.9 K * (1 + 1089) = 6495.9 K.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the calculated temperature is D. 6495.9 kelvin.",
