    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 97 and 30 times the mass of the sun in a binary system with an orbital period of 44 seconds, we can use Kepler's third law and the formula for gravitational waves frequency.\n\nFirstly, we find the semi-major axis of the binary system using Kepler's third law:\nT = 2\u03c0\u221a(a^3 / (G(M1 + M2)))\nWhere T = 44 seconds, M1 = 97 solar masses, M2 = 30 solar masses, and G is the gravitational constant.\n\nConverting the masses to kg:\nM1 = 97 * 1.989e30 kg\nM2 = 30 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nSolving for a, the semi-major axis.\n\nNext, we can calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system:\nf = (1 / \u03c0) * \u221a(G(M1 + M2) / a^3)\n\nSubstitute the values calculated above to find the frequency in Hz.\n\nThe amplitude of the waves when they reach Earth can be found using the formula:\nh = (4 / r) * (G(M1M2) / c^4) * (\u03c9^2) * (a^2)\nWhere r is the distance from the black holes to Earth, c is the velocity of light, and \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the waves (2\u03c0 multiplied by the frequency in Hz).\n\nTo detect these waves, we can use interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and Virgo. These detectors use laser interferometry to measure tiny changes in the length of two perpendicular arms caused by passing gravitational waves.\n\nThe implications of detecting gravitational waves include confirming the existence of black holes, testing general relativity, and opening up a new window into the universe to study catastrophic events such as black hole mergers and supernovae. It also provides new insights into the nature of gravity and the structure of spacetime.",
