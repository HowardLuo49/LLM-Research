What is the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes of masses 97 and 30 times the mass of the sun, orbiting each other in a binary system with an orbital period of 44 seconds? What would be the amplitude of these waves when they reach Earth? Lastly, how could we detect these waves and what are the implications of detecting them?
