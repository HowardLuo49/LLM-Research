    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk:\n\nB = (0.5 * Vrot * R)/(pi * r^2)\n\nWhere:\nB = magnetic field\nVrot = rotational velocity (433 km/s = 4.33 * 10^5 m/s)\nR = radius of the galaxy (50,000 light-years = 4.73 * 10^20 m)\nr = radial distance from the center of the galaxy\n\nAssuming r is half the radius (25,000 light-years = 2.37 * 10^20 m), we can calculate the magnetic field:\n\nB = (0.5 * 4.33 * 10^5 * 4.73 * 10^20) / (pi * (2.37 * 10^20)^2)\nB \u2248 7982 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is approximately 7982 T. \n\nIn a similar non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field would be significantly lower, as the rotational velocity term in the formula would be zero.
