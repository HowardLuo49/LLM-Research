    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we first need to understand the relationship between energy, acceleration, charge, magnetic field, and velocity of light in the context of cosmic rays. Cosmic ray particles are accelerated by strong magnetic fields present in supernova remnants, leading to high-energy particles.\n\nThe energy of a cosmic ray particle can be calculated using the equation: E = q*v*B*r, where E is energy, q is charge, v is velocity, B is magnetic field, and r is the radius of curvature of the particle's path.\n\nGiven that E = 4 TeV = 4*10^12 eV, q = elementary charge = 1.6*10^-19 C, v = velocity of light = 3*10^8 m/s, B = 411 microgauss = 411*10^-6 T, and r (radius of curvature) can be assumed to be approximately the size of the supernova remnant shock wave.\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation to determine the required acceleration to generate a cosmic ray particle with an energy of 4 TeV.\n\n4*10^12 eV = (1.6*10^-19 C)*(3*10^8 m/s)*(411*10^-6 T)*r\nr = (4*10^12 eV) / [(1.6*10^-19 C)*(3*10^8 m/s)*(411*10^-6 T)]\nr = 426 meters\n\nSince acceleration is defined as a = v^2 / r in circular motion, we can now calculate the acceleration required.
