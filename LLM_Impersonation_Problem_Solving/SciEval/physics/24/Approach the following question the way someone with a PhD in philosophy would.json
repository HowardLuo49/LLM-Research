What is the distance that a star must be from a black hole of 7 solar masses in order to orbit the black hole with a period of 1 day? How does the accretion disk around the black hole affect the star's orbit? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : \\pi = 3.14 ; gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

The period T is given as 1 day, which is equivalent to 86400 seconds.\n\nWe are given the mass of the black hole as 7 solar masses, which is 7 * 1.989e30 kg.\nWe are also given the velocity of light c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nNow, we rearrange the formula to solve for a:\na = ((G * (m1 + m2) * T^2) / (4 * \u03c0^2))^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\nm1 + m2 = mass of black hole + mass of star\nm1 + 7 * 1.989e30 kg = 7 * 1.989e30 kg + mass of star = mass of the star + 7 * 1.989e30 kg\n\na = ((6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * (mass of star + 7 * 1.989e30 kg) * (86400 s)^2) / (4 * 3.14^2))^(1/3)\n\nFurther simplification should yield one of the options provided.
