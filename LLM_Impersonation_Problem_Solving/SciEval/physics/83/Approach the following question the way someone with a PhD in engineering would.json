    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected orbital period of a star located at a distance of 38040 light years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy, we can use Kepler's Third Law of planetary motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nFirst, we convert the distance from light years to meters:\nDistance = 38040 light years * 9.461e15 m/light year = 3.6e20 m\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the orbital period:\nT = 2 * \u03c0 * \u221a(R^3 / (G * M)), where R is the distance from the center of the galaxy, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nT = 2 * 3.14 * \u221a((3.6e20)^3 / (6.674e-11 * 1.989e30))\n\nCalculating this expression gives us:\nT = 9.1e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 9.1e+08 years.",
