The mass enclosed in a spherical volume is approximately equal to the mass density times the volume. The mass density of the Milky Way galaxy can be estimated as the average mass density of the visible disk region.\n\nLet's approximate the mass density of the visible disk region as the mass of the visible disk region divided by its volume:\nM_density = M_disk / (4/3 * pi * a^3)\n\nThe mass of the visible disk region can be estimated using the mass-to-light ratio of the Milky Way galaxy and the estimated visible luminosity of the galaxy.\n\nAfter calculating the estimated mass enclosed within the star's orbit (M), we can substitute the values of a, M, and G into the equation for T^2 and solve for T to find the expected orbital period of the star.\n\nThe closest answer choice to the correct answer is D. 8.78e+08 years.",
