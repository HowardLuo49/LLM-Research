    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = 2 * \u03c0 * R / V\n\nWhere R is the radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo (62159 light-years) converted to meters, and V is the velocity of light (3e8 m/s).\n\nFirst, we convert the radius to meters:\n62159 light-years * 9.461e15 m = 5.884e20 meters\n\nThen, we plug the values into the formula:\nRotational period = 2 * 3.14 * 5.884e20 / 3e8\nRotational period = 3.69e12 seconds\n\nTo convert seconds to years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year (60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days):\nRotational period = 3.69e12 / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365)\nRotational period = 1.17e+05 years\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\nA. 5.33e+08 years",
