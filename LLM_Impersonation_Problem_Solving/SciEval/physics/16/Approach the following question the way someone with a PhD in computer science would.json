    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = 2 * \u03c0 * radius / velocity\n\nFirst, we need to convert the average radius of the galactic halo from light-years to meters:\n62159 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year = 5.88e20 meters\n\nNow we can calculate the rotational period:\nRotational period = 2 * 3.14 * 5.88e20 / 3e8\nRotational period = 3.68e+13 seconds\n\nFinally, we can convert the rotational period from seconds to years:\n3.68e+13 seconds * (1 year / 3.15e7 seconds) = 1.17e+06 years\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the correct rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo would be:\nA. 5.33e+08 years",
