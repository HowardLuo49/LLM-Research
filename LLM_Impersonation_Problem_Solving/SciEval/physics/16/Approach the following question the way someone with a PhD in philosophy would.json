    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we need to use the formula for the rotational period of a circular orbit:\n\nT = 2 * \u03c0 * r / v\n\nWhere T is the rotational period, r is the radius of the orbit, and v is the velocity.\n\nGiven that the average radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo is 62159 light-years, we can convert this to meters:\n\n62159 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year = 5.88e20 meters\n\nSince the Milky Way's galactic halo rotates around the galactic center, we can approximate the velocity to be the velocity of light, c = 3e8 m/s.\n\nNow we can calculate the rotational period:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 5.88e20 / 3e8 = 3.69e12 seconds\n\nFinally, we convert the rotational period from seconds to years:\n\n3.69e12 seconds * (1 year / 3.156e7 seconds) = 1.17e5 years\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is:\n\nA. 5.33e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo is approximately 5.33e+08 years.",
