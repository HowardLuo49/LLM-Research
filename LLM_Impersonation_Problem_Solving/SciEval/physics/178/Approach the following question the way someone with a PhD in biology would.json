Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of a sphere where, if an object were compressed to this radius, the escape velocity would equal the speed of light, making it a black hole. It is calculated using the formula Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the object, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 2 solar masses (M = 2*1.989e30 kg), we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 2 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\nRs = 1.1555e-7 / 9e16\nRs = 1.284e-24 m\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the calculated Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses is Option D: 5900 m.",
