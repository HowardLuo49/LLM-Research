    "gpt_response": "To determine the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, we can use the concept of cosmic ray diffusion in a magnetic field. The maximum energy of the particle is reached when the Larmor radius of the particle is equal to the mean free path, which can be expressed as:\n\nE_max = q * B * \u03bb\n\nwhere E_max is the maximum energy, q is the elementary charge, B is the magnetic field strength, and \u03bb is the mean free path.\n\nThe mean free path can be related to the diffusion coefficient D as \u03bb = (D * t)^0.5, where t is the time taken by the particle to diffuse a distance \u03bb. In the interstellar medium, the velocity of the cosmic ray is limited by the speed of light, so t = \u03bb / c.\n\nSubstituting for \u03bb in the expression for E_max, we get:\n\nE_max = q * B * (D * (\u03bb / c))^0.5\n         = q * B * (D / c)^0.5 * (D / c)^0.25\n\nGiven that q = 1.6e-19 C, B = 6e-6 T = 6e-6 gauss, c = 3e8 m/s, and D = 6.1e28 cm^2/s = 6.1e24 m^2/s, we can plug in the values to calculate E_max.\n\nE_max = 1.6e-19 * 6e-6 * (6.1e24 / 3e8)^0.5 * (6.1e24 / 3e8)^0.25\n         = 2.24e+14 eV\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2.24e+14 eV\n\nIf the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 10, the maximum energy would change accordingly. The term involving D in the expression for E_max would increase by a factor of \u221a10, resulting in a higher maximum energy for the cosmic ray proton.",
