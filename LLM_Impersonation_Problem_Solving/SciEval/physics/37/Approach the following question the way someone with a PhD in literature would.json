    "gpt_response": "To calculate the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, we can use the following formula:\n\nE_max = e*B*L\n\nWhere:\nE_max = maximum energy\ne = elementary charge = 1.6e-19 C\nB = magnetic field strength = 6 microgauss = 6e-6 Gauss = 6e-10 Tesla\nL = characteristic length scale = sqrt(D*t) where D = diffusion coefficient\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nL = sqrt(D*t) = sqrt(6.1e28 cm^2/s * t) = sqrt(6.1e22 * t) cm\n\nSince the dimension of diffusion coefficient is cm^2/s, we need to multiply it by the conversion factor of (1 m / 100 cm)^2 to get it in m^2/s:\n\nD = 6.1e28 cm^2/s * (1 m / 100 cm)^2 = 6.1e20 m^2/s * t\n\nNow, we have:\n\nL = sqrt(6.1e20 * t) m = sqrt(6.1e20) m = 2.47e10 m\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum energy:\n\nE_max = e*B*L = 1.6e-19 C * 6e-10 T * 2.47e10 m = 2.37e+1 eV\n\nIf the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 10, the characteristic length scale will increase by a factor of sqrt(10).
