    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the universe's expansion and the relationship between temperature and the scale factor of the universe (T \u221d 1/a), where T is the temperature and a is the scale factor. The scale factor at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the formula a = (age in years)^0.5, which gives a value of approximately 616.2.\n\nUsing the relationship T \u221d 1/a, we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang as follows:\n\nT = (present-day temperature)/a\nT = 6.6 K / 616.2\nT = 0.0107 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 0.0107 Kelvin. \n\nAmong the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nB. 1511.1 kelvin",
