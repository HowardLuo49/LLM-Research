    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmological redshift. The temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation decreases as the universe expands, following a relation known as the Wien displacement law.\n\nThe redshift factor (z) can be calculated using the formula: z = (present temperature / temperature at 380,000 years) - 1\n\nGiven that the present temperature is approximately 6.6 Kelvin and we want to find the temperature at 380,000 years, we have:\nz = (6.6 / T) - 1\n\nBy rearranging the equation, we get: T = 6.6 / (z + 1)\n\nAt an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the redshift factor is approximately 1089. Therefore, the temperature at that time would be:\nT = 6.6 / (1089 + 1) = 6.6 / 1090 = 0.006055 Kelvin\n\nComparing this result to the given options, the closest answer is 0.006 Kelvin, which is not listed among the choices.",
