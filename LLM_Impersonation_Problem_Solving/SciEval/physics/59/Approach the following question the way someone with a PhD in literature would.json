    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to take into account the fact that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation has decreased with the expansion of the universe. \n\nBy using the relation that temperature decreases as the universe expands, we can estimate the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The scale factor of the universe at this time can be calculated by dividing the present scale factor (which is 1) by the scale factor at the age of 380,000 years. \n\nThe temperature at an age of 380,000 years can be calculated by dividing the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (6.6 Kelvin) by the cube root of the scale factor at 380,000 years. \n\nUnfortunately, without the specific scale factor value for 380,000 years after the Big Bang, it is not possible to accurately calculate the temperature. However, based on general trends and assumptions, option C (7266.6 kelvin) appears to be the closest to the correct answer, given the initial temperature of the universe and its subsequent cooling over time.",
