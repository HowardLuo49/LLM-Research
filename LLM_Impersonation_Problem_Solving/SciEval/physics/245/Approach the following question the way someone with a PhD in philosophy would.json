    "gpt_response": "To determine the magnetic field at the center of the loop, we can use the Biot-Savart law. The Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field B at a point due to a current-carrying wire of infinitesimal length dl is given by:\n\ndB = (\u03bc0 / 4\u03c0) * (I * dl x r) / r^3\n\nwhere \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, dl is the infinitesimal length vector, r is the distance from the wire to the point, and x represents the cross product.\n\nSince we have a square loop with side length 8.0 m and a current of 3 A, we can divide the loop into four equal sides of length 8.0 m each. The magnetic field produced by each side at the center will have the same magnitude but different directions. Therefore, we can consider only one side of the loop for simplicity.\n\nFor a single side of the loop, the magnetic field at the center is given by integrating the dB contributions from each infinitesimal length along that side. The total magnetic field at the center is the sum of the contributions from all four sides.\n\nWe can simplify the calculation by considering the total magnetic field due to one side and then multiplying it by 4.\n\nAfter performing the necessary calculations, the closest answer is:\n\nB. 5.93 x 10^(-7) Tesla",
