What is the maximum energy that a cosmic ray proton can attain while propagating through the interstellar medium, assuming a diffusion coefficient of 710^28 cm^2/s and a magnetic field strength of 6 microgauss? How does this maximum energy change if the diffusion coefficient increases by a factor of 10?
