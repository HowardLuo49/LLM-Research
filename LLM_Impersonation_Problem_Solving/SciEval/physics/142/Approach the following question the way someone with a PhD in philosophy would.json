Plugging in the given values and converting masses to kg using the solar mass constant, we get:\n\nL = (32 * 60 * (32 + 60)) / (32 + 60)^(4/5)\nL = (32 * 60 * (32 + 60)) / (32 + 60)^(4/5)\nL = (1920) / (92)^(4/5)\nL = 1920 / 44.185\nL = 43.47\n\nNow, to calculate the energy, we use the formula for the energy flux of gravitational waves:\n\nF = (128 / 5) * (G / c^5) * (M1 * M2)^(5/3) / d^2\n\nWhere F is the energy flux of gravitational waves, G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes, and d is the distance to the detector.
