    "gpt_response": "To find the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 1 solar mass, we can use the formula for the Schwarzschild radius:\n\nr = 2GM/c^2\n\nPlugging in the values for G, M, and c:\n\nr = 2*(6.674e-11)*(1.989e30) / (3e8)^2\nr = 2*(6.674e-11)*(1.989e30) / (9e16)\nr = 2*(1.3276e20) / (9e16)\nr = 2.6552e20 / 9e16\nr = 2.955e4\n\nTherefore, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 1 solar mass is approximately 29550 meters, which is closest to option A.",
