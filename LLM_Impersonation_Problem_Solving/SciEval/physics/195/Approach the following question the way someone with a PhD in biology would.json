    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy, we can use the equation for magnetic field strength in a rotating disk:\n\nB = sqrt(2*mu*rho*omega)\n\nWhere B is the magnetic field strength, mu is the vacuum permeability (4*pi x 10^-7 T m/A), rho is the density of the galaxy (assumed to be 1 solar mass/pc^3), r is the radius of the galaxy (50,000 light-years = 4.73 x 10^20 m), and omega is the rotational velocity of the galaxy (368 km/s = 3.68 x 10^5 m/s).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = sqrt(2 * 4 * pi * 10^-7 * 1 * 4.73 x 10^20 * 3.68 x 10^5)\nB = sqrt(1.98 x 10^-4) T\nB = 0.01407 T\n\nTherefore, the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster with a radius of 50,000 light-years and a rotational velocity of 368 km/s is approximately 0.014 T.\n\nIn comparison, a similar non-rotating galaxy would not have a significant magnetic field generated by rotation, so the magnetic field strength would be close to 0 T.\n\nOption B. 2070 T is the closest to the correct answer.",
