The rigidity is defined as the momentum per unit charge of the particle and is given by:\n\nR = p/e,\n\nwhere p is the momentum of the proton, e is the elementary charge.\n\nThe maximum energy that the proton can attain is when the Larmor radius (r_L) of the particle due to its gyration in the magnetic field is equal to the mean free path of the particle due to diffusion in the interstellar medium.
