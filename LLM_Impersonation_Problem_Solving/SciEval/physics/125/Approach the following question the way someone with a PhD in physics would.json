    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's Law, which relates the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation spectrum to its temperature. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_peak * T = b\n\nWhere b is Wien's displacement constant, which is equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 799.9 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere c is the speed of light in vacuum (2.998 x 10^8 m/s). Plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bb = 2.998 x 10^8 / 799.9 x 10^9\n\u03bb = 0.374854 x 10^-3 m\n\nNow we can solve for the temperature:\n\n0.374854 x 10^-3 * T = 2.898 x 10^-3\n\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 / 0.374854 x 10^-3\nT = 7.73 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.73 K. So, the correct answer from the given choices is:\n\nD. 7.73 K",
