    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the wavelength of peak emission of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is \u03bb_max = (2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 mK) / T, where \u03bb_max is the wavelength of peak emission and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that the frequency peaks at 799.9 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the formula c = \u03bb\u03bd, where c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and \u03bd is the frequency. We find that the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency is 0.375 mm or 375 \u03bcm.\n\nNow we can use the relationship between wavelength and temperature to find the temperature corresponding to this peak wavelength. Rearranging the formula to solve for T, we get T = (2.898 \u00d7 10^-3 mK) / \u03bb_max. Plugging in the peak wavelength of 375 \u03bcm (or 3.75 x 10^-4 m), we get T \u2248 7.73 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 7.73 K.",
