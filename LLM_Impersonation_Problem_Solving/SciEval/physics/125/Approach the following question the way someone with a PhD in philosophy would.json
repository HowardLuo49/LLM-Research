    "gpt_response": "First, we must use Wien's displacement law to determine the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This law states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula is:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = b\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and b is Wien's displacement constant, which is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m K.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at around 799.9 GHz, we can convert this frequency to wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (799.9 x 10^9 Hz)\n\u03bb \u2248 0.375 m = 375 mm\n\nNow, we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\n0.375 m * T = 2.898 x 10^-3 m K\nT \u2248 7.73 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 7.73 K",
