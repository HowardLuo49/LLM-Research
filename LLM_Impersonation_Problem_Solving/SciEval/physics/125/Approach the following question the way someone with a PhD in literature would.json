    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength of a blackbody radiation is inversely proportional to its temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m-K) and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that the peak frequency of the CMB radiation is 799.9 GHz, we can convert this frequency into wavelength using the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nWhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nSubstitute the given frequency into the formula to find the corresponding wavelength:\n\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (799.9 x 10^9 Hz) \u2248 0.375 m\n\nNow we can use Wien's displacement law to find the temperature:\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max\nT = 2.898 x 10^-3 m-K / 0.375 m \u2248 7.728 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 7.73 K.\n\nOption D. 7.73 K is the closest to the correct answer.",
