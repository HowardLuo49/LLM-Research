    "gpt_response": "Firstly, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated using Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength at which the radiation peaks is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody radiator. The equation is given by:\n\n\u03bb_max T = b\n\nWhere \u03bb_max is the wavelength at which the radiation peaks, T is the temperature of the blackbody, and b is a constant equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m K.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the radiation peaks at 799.9 GHz, we can convert this to wavelength using the equation:\n\nc = \u03bbf\n\nWhere c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Thus, \u03bb = c / f.\n\nSubstitute the values of c and f into the equation to find the corresponding wavelength. \n\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (799.9 x 10^9 Hz) = 0.375 m = 375 mm\n\nNow, we can use this peak wavelength to find the temperature of the CMB radiation:\n\n\u03bb_max T = b\n\nT = b / \u03bb_max = (2.898 x 10^-3 m K) / 0.375 m = 7.728 K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 7.73 k.",
