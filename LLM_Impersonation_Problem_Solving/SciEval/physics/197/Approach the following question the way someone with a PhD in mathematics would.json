    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field in the galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk:\n\nB = (2 * V_rot) / (R)\n\nwhere:\nB = magnetic field\nV_rot = rotational velocity (in m/s)\nR = radius (in m)\n\nConverting the rotational velocity from km/s to m/s:\nV_rot = 356 km/s * 1000 m/km = 356,000 m/s\n\nPlugging in the values:\nB = (2 * 356,000) / (50,000 * 3.086e+16) = 0.00459 T\n\nSo, the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is approximately 0.00459 T. \n\nComparing this to a similar non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field in the non-rotating galaxy would be zero as there is no rotational velocity contributing to the magnetic field.
