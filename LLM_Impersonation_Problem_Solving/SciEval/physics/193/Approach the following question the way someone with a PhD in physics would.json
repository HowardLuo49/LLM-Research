    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the formula for the magnetic field in a rotating disk:\n\nB = (0.5 * v * R) / \u03bc\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, v is the rotational velocity, R is the radius of the galaxy, and \u03bc is the permeability of free space.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (0.5 * 241 km/s * 50,000 ly) / (4\u03c0 * 10^-7 Tm/A)\n\nB = (0.5 * 241 * 9.461e+17 m) / (4\u03c0 * 10^-7)\n\nB = (113,251,105 m/s) / (1.2566e-6)\n\nB = 90,014,051.39 T\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is approximately 90,014,000 T.\n\nTo compare this with a similar non-rotating galaxy, we can consider that in a non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field would be significantly weaker as there would be no contribution from the rotational velocity. Therefore, the magnetic field in a similar non-rotating galaxy would be significantly lower than 90,014,000 T.\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 9346 T",
