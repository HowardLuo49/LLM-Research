    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild, is a characteristic radius associated with a non-rotating black hole. It is the distance from the center of the black hole to the event horizon, beyond which no information or matter can escape. The formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius is given by Rs = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven M = 9 solar masses = 9 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.7901e31 kg, G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2, and c = 3e8 m/s, we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius as:\n\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 1.7901e31 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\nRs = 23.9014e20 m / 9e16 m^2\nRs = 2.6557e5 m\n\nTherefore, the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses is 265,570 meters, which is closest to option D.",
