    "gpt_response": "To calculate the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 4 solar masses, we use the formula for the Schwarzschild radius:\nRs = 2GM/c^2\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the black hole to kilograms:\nMass of black hole = 4 solar masses x 1.989e30 kg = 7.956e30 kg\n\nNow we can substitute the values into the formula:\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 7.956e30 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2\nRs = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 7.956e30 / 9e16\nRs = 10.62e20 / 9e16\nRs = 11800 meters\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 11800 m",
