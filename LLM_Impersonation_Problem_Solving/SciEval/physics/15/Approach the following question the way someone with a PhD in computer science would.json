    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nRotational period = (2 * \u03c0 * r) / v\n\nwhere:\nr = average radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo in meters = 28603 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year\nv = velocity of light = 3e8 m/s\n\u03c0 = 3.14\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nRotational period = (2 * 3.14 * 28603 * 9.461e15) / 3e8\nRotational period = (6.28 * 270307.42e15) / 3e8\nRotational period = 1694082.61e15 / 300e8\nRotational period = 5646.9421e7\nRotational period = 5.647e+09 years\n\nThe closest option to the calculated value is:\n\nD. 6.07e+08 years\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6.07e+08 years.",
