    "gpt_response": "To determine the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula for calculating the rotational period of a body in circular motion:\n\nRotational period = 2\u03c0 * radius / velocity\n\nGiven:\n- Average radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo = 28603 light-years = 28603 * 9.461e15 m (conversion from light-years to meters)\n- Constant \u03c0 = 3.14\n- Velocity of light, c = 3e8 m/s\n\nPlugging in the values:\nRotational period = 2 * 3.14 * 28603 * 9.461e15 / 3e8\n\nCalculating this will give us the rotational period in seconds.
