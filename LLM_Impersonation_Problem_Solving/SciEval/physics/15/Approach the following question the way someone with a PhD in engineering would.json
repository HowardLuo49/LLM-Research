    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula:\n\nT = 2 * \u03c0 * R / V\n\nwhere:\nT = rotational period\nR = radius of the halo in meters (28603 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year)\nV = velocity of light (3e8 m/s)\n\nFirst, calculate the radius of the halo in meters:\nR = 28603 light-years * 9.461e15 m/light-year = 2.706e20 m\n\nNow, plug in the values into the formula:\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 2.706e20 / 3e8\nT = 5.396e20 / 3e8\nT = 1.7987e+12 seconds\n\nConvert seconds to years:\n1.7987e+12 seconds * (1 year / 3.1536e7 seconds) = 5.694e+04 years\n\nTherefore, the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo is closest to option A: 3.97e+08 years.",
