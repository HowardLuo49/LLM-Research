    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude of gravitational waves, we can use the formula: h = 2*(G/c^4)*(mu/(r*pi^2*f^2))^(2/3), where h is the amplitude, G is the gravitational constant, c is the velocity of light, mu is the reduced mass of the black holes, r is the distance to the source, f is the frequency of the gravitational waves.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the reduced mass of the black holes using the formula: mu = (m1*m2)/(m1 + m2), where m1 = 27 solar masses and m2 = 66 solar masses.\n\nmu = (27*66)/(27+66) = 17.676 solar masses\n\nConverting the reduced mass to kg: mu = 17.676 * 1.989e30 kg = 3.52e31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves using the formula: f = c^3/(6*sqrt(3)*pi*G*(m1+m2)), where m1 and m2 are the masses of the black holes.\n\nf = 3e8^3 / (6*sqrt(3)*pi*6.674e-11*(27+66)*1.989e30) = 2.434e-8 Hz\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the amplitude formula to calculate the expected amplitude:\n\nh = 2*(6.674e-11 / 3e8^4) * (3.52e31 / (1e9 * 9.461e15 * 3.14^2 * 2.434e-8)^2/3 = 1.106e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves is 1.106e-21.\n\nNext, to calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the LIGO detector, we can use the formula: SNR = h/sqrt(4*f*time), where h is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and time is the duration of the observation.\n\nGiven that LIGO typically observes events for around 0.4 seconds, we can calculate the SNR:\n\nSNR = 1.106e-21 / sqrt(4 * 2.434e-8 * 0.4) = 9.94e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector is 9.94e-21, which is closest to option C.",
