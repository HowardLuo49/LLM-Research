This law states that the magnetic field at a point due to a current-carrying element is proportional to the current, the length of the current-carrying element, and the sine of the angle between the position vector of the point and the current-carrying element.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the magnetic field at a distance of 8 cm from the center of the wire, which corresponds to the edge of the cylinder. The total magnetic field at this point can be found by integrating the contributions from all points along the wire.\n\nGiven that the radius of the wire is 4 cm and the current is 2 A, we can set up the integral to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field as follows:\n\nB = ( \\mu_0 * I * r^2 ) / (2 * (r^2 - R^2)^1.5)\n\nPlugging in the values, we find:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 2 * (0.08)^2) / (2 * (0.08^2 - 0.04^2)^1.5)\nB = (2.016 * 10^(-8)) / (2 * (0.0064 - 0.0016)^1.5)\nB = 0.96 * 10^(-5) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.81 x 10^(-5) Tesla",
