    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray with an energy of 5 e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the following formula for the probability of interaction:\n\nP = 1 - e^(-\u03c3 * N * x)\n\nWhere:\nP = Probability of interaction\n\u03c3 = Cross-sectional area for interaction\nN = Number density of target particles\nx = Thickness of target\n\nGiven that the energy of the cosmic ray is 5 e+18 eV, we can convert this to joules using the relationship 1 eV = 1.6022e-19 Joules, resulting in 8.01e-1 Joules. In the case of a typical human body, the absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, and the thickness of a typical human body can be approximated as 2 meters. The number density of target particles can be taken as the number of atoms in the body.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of target particles using Avogadro's number (6.022e23 atoms/mol) and the molar mass of a human body (approximately 35 kg/mol), and multiply this by the body mass (let's assume 70 kg) to get the total number of target particles.\n\nNext, we can calculate the cross-sectional area for interaction \u03c3 using the absorption area A and the number of target particles. Plugging all these values into the formula for the probability of interaction, we can calculate the probability of a cosmic ray passing through a typical human body.\n\nFor the estimation of the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body, we can use the absorbed dose formula:\n\nD = E * \u03a6\n\nWhere:\nD = Absorbed dose (in Gy)\nE = Energy deposited by the cosmic ray (in joules)\n\u03a6 = Absorption factor\n\nThe absorption factor \u03a6 can be determined by the material of the human body and the energy of the cosmic ray. By multiplying the energy deposited by the probability of interaction, we can find the absorbed dose.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the closest answer option is:\n\nC. 1.19e-13 Gy",
