    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 5e+18 eV passing through a typical human body, we can use the following formula:\n\nP = e^(-mu*x)\n\nwhere:\nP = probability\nmu = mass attenuation coefficient\nx = thickness of the body\n\nGiven that the typical human body has an absorption area A = 0.1 m^2, we need to convert this into a thickness. Assuming the body is a cylinder with a diameter of 0.2 m (typical human body size) and assuming the body is about 1 m tall, the thickness (x) would be approximately 0.1 m.\n\nLet's assume a typical mass attenuation coefficient for body tissue is around 0.15 m^-1. Therefore, the probability of a cosmic ray passing through the body would be:\n\nP = e^(-0.15 * 0.1) = e^(-0.015) \u2248 0.985\n\nNow, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we need to consider the absorbed dose (Gy) which is directly related to the energy of the cosmic ray. The absorbed dose can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAbsorbed Dose = Energy * Mass absorption coefficient / (absorption area * density of human tissue)\n\nGiven that the mass absorption coefficient of tissue is around 0.1 m^2/kg and the density of human tissue is around 1000 kg/m^3, the absorbed dose would be:\n\nAbsorbed Dose = (5e+18) * 0.1 / (0.1 * 1000) = 1e+17 / 100 = 1e+15 Gy\n\nThe closest option to this estimate is:\n\nC. 1.19e-13 Gy\n\nTherefore, option C is the closest to the correct answer.",
