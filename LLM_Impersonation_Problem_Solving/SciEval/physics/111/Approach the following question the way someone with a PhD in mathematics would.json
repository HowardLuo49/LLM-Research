    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray passing through a typical human body, we first need to determine the cross-sectional area of the body along the path of the cosmic ray. Let's assume the human body can be approximated as a cylinder with a radius of about 0.1 meters and a height of about 1.7 meters (average height of a human). Therefore, the absorption area A = \u03c0r^2, where r = 0.1 meters. \n\nGiven that A = 0.1 m^2, the probability of the cosmic ray passing through the body is P = A/\u03c0r^2 = 0.1/\u03c0*0.1^2 = 0.1/0.0314 \u2248 3.18 x 10^-3.\n\nNow, to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray, we can use the concept of absorbed dose, which is measured in Gray (Gy).
