    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the relationship between the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the age of the universe. The temperature of the universe is inversely proportional to the age of the universe, meaning that as the universe expands, the temperature decreases.\n\nThe relationship between the temperature (T) and the age of the universe (t) is given by the formula:\n\nT0 / T = (t0 / t)^0.377\n\nwhere T0 is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (9.0 Kelvin), t0 is the present age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), and t is the age of the universe at the time in question (380,000 years).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n9.0 / T = (13.8 billion years / 380,000 years)^0.377\nT = 9.0 / (13.8 * 10^9 / 380,000)^0.377\nT \u2248 3148.4 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3148.4 Kelvin",
