    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation:\n\nT_obs = T_CMB / (1 + z)\n\nwhere T_obs is the observed temperature, T_CMB is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (9.0 Kelvin), and z is the redshift. The redshift can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (current age of the universe) / (age of the universe at observation)\n\nSince the current age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, and the age of the universe at observation is 380,000 years, we can calculate the redshift as:\n\n1 + z = 13.8 billion years / 380,000 years\nz = 36,315\n\nPlugging this redshift value back into the first formula, we can calculate the temperature at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang as:\n\nT_obs = 9.0 Kelvin / (1 + 36,315)\nT_obs \u2248 9.0 Kelvin / 36,315\nT_obs \u2248 0.0002473 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2212.2 kelvin",
