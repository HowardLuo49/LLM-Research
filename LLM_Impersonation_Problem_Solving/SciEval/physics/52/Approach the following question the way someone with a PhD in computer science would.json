    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of redshift. The relationship between the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the age of the universe is given by the formula:\n\nT = To / (1 + z)\n\nWhere:\nT = temperature of the universe at a given age\nTo = temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation today (9.0 Kelvin)\nz = redshift\n\nThe redshift z can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (age of the universe in the past / age of the universe today)\n\n1 + z = (380,000 years / 13.8 billion years) = 2.7536 x 10^-5\n\nTherefore, z = 2.7536 x 10^-5 - 1 = 2.7536 x 10^-5\n\nNow, we can plug this value of z into the first formula to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\n\nT = 9.0 Kelvin / (1 + 2.7536 x 10^-5) = 3148.4 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3148.4 kelvin",
