    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The temperature of the CMB radiation is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe. \n\nGiven that the present-day temperature of the CMB is 9.0 Kelvin, we can use the formula T_final = T_initial / (1 + z). Here, z is the redshift factor, which can be calculated using the formula z = (t_final / t_initial) - 1, where t_final is the age of the universe we are interested in (380,000 years), and t_initial is the present age of the universe.\n\nSince the present age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, we first need to convert 380,000 years to fraction of the present age:\nz = (380,000 years / 13.8 billion years) - 1\n\nz \u2248 0.0000275\n\nNow, we can calculate the temperature at the age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang:\nT_final = 9.0 Kelvin / (1 + 0.0000275)\n\nT_final \u2248 9.0 Kelvin / 1.0000275 \u2248 8.999971 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is A. 3148.4 kelvin.",
