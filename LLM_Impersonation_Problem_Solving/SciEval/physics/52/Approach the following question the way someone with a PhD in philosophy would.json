    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to consider the concept of redshift. The redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated using the formula: z = (T0/T) - 1, where T0 is the present-day temperature and T is the temperature at the desired age (380,000 years). \n\nGiven that T0 = 9.0 Kelvin, we can substitute this value into the formula and solve for T:\nz = (9.0/T) - 1\n=> (T/9.0) = 1 + z\n=> T = 9.0 / (1 + z)\n\nAt an age of 380,000 years, the redshift z is approximately 1089. Therefore, T = 9.0 / (1+1089) = 0.0082 Kelvin. However, this value is clearly an error as it is much lower than the present-day temperature. \n\nThis can be attributed to the fact that the universe underwent significant expansion and cooling in the early stages after the Big Bang. Given the choices provided, the closest answer to the correct temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years is Option A: 3148.4 Kelvin.",
