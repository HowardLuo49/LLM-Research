    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula for the frequency of gravitational waves generated by a binary system as:\n\nf = (c^3 / \u03c0) * (G * M_total) / (8 * \u03c0^3 * a^3), \n\nwhere f is the frequency of gravitational waves, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, M_total is the total mass of the binary system, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\nM_total = 38 + 71 = 109 times the mass of the sun = 109 * 1.989e30 kg,\na = (92 seconds / 2\u03c0)^(2/3) * G * M_total = (46 / pi)^(2/3) * 6.674e-11 * 109 * 1.989e30 = 1.218e16 m.\n\nNow, calculate the frequency of the gravitational waves:\n\nf = (3e8^3 / 3.14) * (6.674e-11 * 109 * 1.989e30) / (8 * 3.14^3 * (1.218e16)^3) = 2.73e-15 Hz.\n\nNext, to calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth, we can use the formula for the amplitude of gravitational waves as:\n\nh = (4 * G * M_total * (\u03c0 * f)^2 / c^4)^(1/3),\n\nwhere h is the amplitude of gravitational waves.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11 * 109 * 1.989e30 * (pi * 2.73e-15)^2 / 3e8^4)^(1/3) = 7.47e-15.\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the two black holes is 2.73e-15 Hz and the amplitude when they reach Earth would be 7.47e-15. \n\nTo detect these waves, we would use interferometers like LIGO or VIRGO, which are sensitive enough to measure the tiny displacements caused by passing gravitational waves.
