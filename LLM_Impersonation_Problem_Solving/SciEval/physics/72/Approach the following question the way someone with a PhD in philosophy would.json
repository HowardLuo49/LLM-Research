    "gpt_response": "To determine the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the concept of kinetic energy. The initial energy of the star can be calculated by using the formula E = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the initial mass of the star and v is the velocity at which the explosion occurs.\n\nGiven:\nInitial mass of the star, m = 99 solar masses = 99 * 1.989e30 kg\nVelocity of explosion, v = 10,000 km/s = 10,000 * 1000 m/s\n\nTherefore, the initial energy of the star is calculated as:\nE = (1/2) * 99 * 1.989e30 * (10,000 * 1000)^2\n\nNext, the total energy released in the supernova explosion can be found by considering the remnant mass. The energy released will be the difference between the initial energy of the star and the energy associated with the remnant mass through E = mc^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven:\nMass of the remnant, m = 1.6 solar masses = 1.6 * 1.989e30 kg\nSpeed of light, c = 3e8 m/s\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the supernova explosion is calculated as:\nE_total = E_initial - (1.6 * 1.989e30 * (3e8)^2)\n\nBy plugging in the values and performing the calculations, the closest answer to the correct value is 1.74e+49 J (Option C).",
