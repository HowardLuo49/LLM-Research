What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.6 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 99 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 7.66e+48 J\nB. 8.49e+48 J\nC. 1.74e+49 J\nD. 3.27e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass lost during the explosion, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass lost during the explosion. The initial mass of the star is 99 solar masses, and the remnant mass is 1.6 solar masses, so the mass lost is 99 - 1.6 = 97.4 solar masses. Converting this to kilograms, we get 97.4 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.938e32 kg.\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released using the formula E=mc^2, where m = 1.938e32 kg and c = 3e8 m/s. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nE = 1.938e32 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.938e32 kg * 9e16 m^2/s^2\nE = 1.7442e49 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is C. 1.74e+49 J.",
