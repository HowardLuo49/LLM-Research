What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.6 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 99 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: \n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the remnant from solar masses to kilograms: \n1.6 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass = 3.1824e30 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the kinetic energy released: \nKE = 0.5 * 3.1824e30 kg * (10,000 km/s)^2 = 1.5912e37 kg m^2/s^2\n\nThis energy is in Joules, which is equivalent to kg m^2/s^2.
