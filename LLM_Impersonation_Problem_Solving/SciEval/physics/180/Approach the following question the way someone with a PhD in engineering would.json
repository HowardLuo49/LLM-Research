Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 10284 m\nB. 26549 m\nC. 41826 m\nD. 56436 m\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, denoted by Rs, is the radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. It is defined by the equation Rs = 2GM / c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the black hole is 9 solar masses, the first step is to convert this value to kilograms. 1 solar mass is equal to 1.989e30 kg, so a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses would be 9*1.989e30 kg = 1.7901e31 kg.\n\nPlugging in the values into the Schwarzschild radius equation, we get Rs = 2 * 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 * 1.7901e31 kg / (3e8 m/s)^2 = 26549.6571 meters.\n\nThe closest option to the calculated value is:\n\nB. 26549 m.",
