Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "The Schwarzschild radius, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild, is the radius at which the gravitational pull of a black hole becomes so strong that not even light can escape from it. It is defined as R = 2GM/c^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nTo calculate the Schwarzschild radius for a black hole with a mass of 9 solar masses, we first need to convert the mass to kilograms by multiplying by the mass of the sun (1.989e30 kg). So, M = 9 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.79e31 kg.\n\nPlugging in the values of G, M, and c into the formula, we get R = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 1.79e31 / (3e8)^2 = 26549 m.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is B. 26549 m.",
