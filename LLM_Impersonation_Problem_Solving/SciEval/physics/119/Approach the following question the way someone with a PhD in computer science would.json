So, the energy of the cosmic ray is 9e+18 * 1.60218e-19 = 1.441962e-1 Joules.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the mass attenuation coefficient for a typical human body. Let's assume a density of 1 g/cm^3 for the human body. The average atomic number of the human body can be approximated to 6.25. Using these values, we can calculate the mass attenuation coefficient using known constants.\n\nNow, given that the absorption area is 0.1 m^2, we can calculate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body using the formula:\n\nDose = Energy * P * \u03bc * A / m\n\nWhere:\nEnergy = 1.441962e-1 J\nP = Probability of interaction\n\u03bc = Mass attenuation coefficient\nA = Absorption area = 0.1 m^2\nm = Mass of the body\n\nBy substituting the calculated values and solving the equation, we can determine the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to the cosmic ray.\n\nComparing the calculated dose with the given choices, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 6.46e-13 Gy",
