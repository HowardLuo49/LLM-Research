    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we can calculate the expected frequency of the gravitational waves using the formula:\n\nf = 1/ (2\u03c0) * (G * (M1 + M2) / c^3 * (M1 * M2) / (M1 + M2))^(3/2)\n\nwhere M1 = 50 * solar mass = 50 * 1.989e30 kg and M2 = 40 * solar mass = 40 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nPlugging in the values and solving for f, we get:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0) * (6.674e-11 * (50 + 40) / (3e8)^3 * (50 * 40) / (50 + 40))^(3/2) = 1.87e-15 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves. The amplitude can be approximated by the following formula:\n\nh = (4G / c^4)^(1/3) * (\u03c0f)^(2/3) * (M1 * M2) / d\n\nwhere d is the distance from the source to the observer. If we consider this distance as 1 light year = 9.461e15 m, then plugging in the values we get:\n\nh = (4 * 6.674e-11 / (3e8)^4)^(1/3) * (\u03c0 * 1.87e-15)^(2/3) * (50 * 40) / (9.461e15) = 1.86e-15\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer for the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth is B. 1.86e-15.\n\nFinally, to detect these waves, we would need incredibly sensitive detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The implications of detecting these waves would be groundbreaking as it would provide evidence for the existence of black holes, confirm predictions of general relativity, and open up a new way to study the universe.",
