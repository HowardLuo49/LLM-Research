    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 14 and 68 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, we can use the following equations:\n\n1. The frequency of gravitational waves produced by black holes orbiting each other is given by f = c^3 / (\u03c0 * G * (M1 + M2)), where c is the velocity of light, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the black holes.\n\nSubstitute the values: f = (3e8)^3 / (3.14 * 6.674e-11 * (14 + 68) * 1.989e30)\n\nCalculating the frequency gives us f = 6.7e-21 Hz.\n\n2. The expected amplitude of gravitational waves is given by h = G * (M1 * M2) / c^4 * R, where R is the distance to the black holes.\n\nSubstitute the values: h = 6.674e-11 * (14 * 68) / (3e8)^4 * (1e9 * 9.461e15)\n\nCalculating the amplitude gives us h = 1.4e-21.\n\nNow, to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the LIGO detector, we use the formula SNR = h / noise, where the noise for LIGO is typically around 2.5e-23.\n\nTherefore, SNR = 1.4e-21 / 2.5e-23 = 56.\n\nThe closest option to the calculated SNR of 56 is:\n\nA. 5.09e-20\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 5.09e-20.",
