    "gpt_response": "To calculate the magnetic field at the center of the rectangular loop, we can use the formula for the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire, which is given by B = (\\mu_0 * I) / (2 * \\pi * r), where B is the magnetic field, \\mu_0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.\n\nIn this case, the current I is 3 A and the dimensions of the rectangular loop are 4.0 m x 8.0 m. Since we are interested in the magnetic field at the center of the loop, the distance r from the wire to the center is half of the width of the loop, which is 4.0 m / 2 = 2.0 m.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get B = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 3) / (2 * 3.14 * 2) = 3.18 x 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is D. 3.18 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
