The formula for the magnetic field at the center of a rectangular loop is given by B = \u03bc0 * I * (w/2) / ((w/2)^2 + (l/2)^2), where B is the magnetic field, \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, I is the current, w is the width of the loop, and l is the length of the loop.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we have B = (1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m)) * 3 A * (4.0 m/2) / ((4.0 m/2)^2 + (8.0 m/2)^2).\n\nCalculating this expression, we find B = 3.28 x 10^(-7) Tesla.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 3.28 x 10^(-7) Tesla.",
