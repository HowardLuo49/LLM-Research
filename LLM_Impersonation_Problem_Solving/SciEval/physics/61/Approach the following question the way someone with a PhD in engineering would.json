    "gpt_response": "In a type Ia supernova explosion, the entire mass of a white dwarf star is converted into energy. The kinetic energy released in this explosion can be calculated using the formula for kinetic energy, which is KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity of the object.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass of the white dwarf star in kilograms. Given that the mass of the white dwarf star is 5.4 solar masses and 1 solar mass = 1.989e30 kg, the mass of the white dwarf star in kilograms would be:\n\n5.4 * 1.989e30 = 1.07346e31 kg\n\nSince the entire mass is converted into energy, we can use Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 to calculate the total energy released:\n\nE = 1.07346e31 * (3e8)^2\nE = 9.66114e46 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 9.68e+48 J",
