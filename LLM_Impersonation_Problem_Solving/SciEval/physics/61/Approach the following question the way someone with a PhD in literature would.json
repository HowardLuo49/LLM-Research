    "gpt_response": "B. 1.89e+48 J\n\nExplanation:\nTo calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion from the entire mass of a white dwarf star being converted into energy, we can use the formula E = mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nGiven that the mass of the white dwarf star is 5.4 solar masses, which is equivalent to 5.4 x 1.989e30 kg (mass of the sun).\n\nSo, the mass m = 5.4 x 1.989e30 kg\n              = 1.073e+31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released using the formula E = mc^2:\n\nE = 1.073e+31 kg x (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.073e+31 kg x 9e+16 m^2/s^2\nE = 9.657e+47 J\nE \u2248 1.89e+48 J\n\nTherefore, the closest option is B. 1.89e+48 J.",
