What is the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, assuming the entire mass of a white dwarf star (5.4solar masses) is converted into energy? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 2.0e+48 J\nB. 1.89e+48 J\nC. 9.68e+48 J\nD. 9.67e+47 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the kinetic energy released in a type Ia supernova explosion, we need to use the equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass of the white dwarf, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the mass of the white dwarf star from solar masses to kilograms:\nmass_white_dwarf = 5.4 solar masses = 5.4 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.07326e31 kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the energy released:\nE = (1.07326e31 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 9.65934e47 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be closest to option D: 9.67e+47 J.",
