    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of the two black holes, we can use Einstein's formula for gravitational radiation:\n\nf = (c^3 / G) * (M1 + M2) / (pi * D)\n\nWhere:\nf = frequency of the gravitational waves\nc = speed of light\nG = gravitational constant\nM1 = mass of the first black hole\nM2 = mass of the second black hole\nD = distance from the Earth\n\nSubstitute in the given values:\nM1 = 85 solar masses = 85 * 1.989e30 kg\nM2 = 47 solar masses = 47 * 1.989e30 kg\nD = 1 billion light-years = 1e9 * 9.461e15 m\n\nCalculating the frequency of the gravitational waves using the formula gives:\nf = (3e8^3 / 6.674e-11) * (85*1.989e30 + 47*1.989e30) / (3.14 * 1e9 * 9.461e15) = 5.79e-3 Hz\n\nNext, we can calculate the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves using the formula:\n\nh = (4 * (G * M1 * M2) / (c^4 * D))^(1/3)\n\nSubstitute in the given values and calculate:\nh = (4 * (6.674e-11 * 85*1.989e30 * 47*1.989e30) / (3e8^4 * 1e9 * 9.461e15))^(1/3) = 5.79e-21\n\nTherefore, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves is 5.79e-21 and the frequency is 5.79e-3 Hz. \n\nTo calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector, we need to consider the sensitivity of the detector, background noise, and the accumulated signal-to-noise ratio.
