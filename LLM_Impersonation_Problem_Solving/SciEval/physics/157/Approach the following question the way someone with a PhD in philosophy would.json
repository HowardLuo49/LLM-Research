    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected amplitude of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of two black holes with masses of 85 and 47 solar masses located at a distance of 1 billion light-years from Earth, we can use the formula for gravitational wave amplitude:\n\nh = (4/3) (G/c^4)^(5/3) (M_chirp)^(5/3) (\u03c0*f)^(2/3)\n\nwhere M_chirp is the chirp mass, given by M_chirp = (m1*m2)^(3/5)/(m1 + m2)^(1/5), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes.\n\nGiven that m1 = 85 solar masses, m2 = 47 solar masses, and the distance is 1 billion light-years (9.461e24 meters), we can calculate the chirp mass:\n\nM_chirp = ((85*47)^(3/5))/((85+47)^(1/5)) * (1.989e30 kg) = 31.3 solar masses * (1.989e30 kg) = 6.23e32 kg\n\nNow we need to find the frequency of the gravitational waves. The frequency is twice the orbital frequency when the black holes are at a distance a, where a = c^2/(G*(m1+m2)):\n\nf = 2*c^3/(\u03c0*a^1.5) = 2*c^3/(\u03c0*(c^2/(G*(m1+m2)))^1.5) = 2*sqrt(G*(m1+m2)/(\u03c0*c^3)) = 75.3 Hz\n\nNow we can calculate the amplitude of the gravitational waves:\n\nh = (4/3) (6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 / (3e8 m/s)^4)^(5/3) * (6.23e32 kg)^(5/3) * (\u03c0*75.3 Hz)^(2/3) = 5.60e-20\n\nTherefore, the expected amplitude of the gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of these two black holes is closest to option B: 5.60e-20.\n\nTo calculate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector, we need to use the formula:\n\nSNR = h/\u221a(S_n(f))\n\nwhere S_n(f) is the power spectral noise density of the detector. For LIGO, the noise density is approximately S_n(f) = 3e-44 Hz^-1/2.\n\nTherefore, the signal-to-noise ratio is:\n\nSNR = 5.60e-20 / \u221a(3e-44) = 9.69e22\n\nThis value is closest to option D: 8.96e22.",
