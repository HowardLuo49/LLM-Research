After performing the calculations, the expected amplitude is approximately 5.60e-20 and the expected frequency is approximately 6.63e-21.\n\nNow, the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector can be calculated using the formula:\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio = (Amplitude) / (Noise)\nwhere the Noise depends on the detector sensitivity and characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer for the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the LIGO detector is:\nB. 5.60e-20",
