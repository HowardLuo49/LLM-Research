What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 9.5 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 104 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "Firstly, let's calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion. \n\nThe mass defect (\u0394m) in the supernova can be calculated using the formula: \n\u0394m = initial mass - mass of remnant \n\u0394m = 104 solar masses - 9.5 solar masses\n\u0394m = 94.5 solar masses\n\nConverting this mass defect to kilograms:\n\u0394m = 94.5 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg = 1.881e32 kg\n\nThe energy released in the supernova explosion can be calculated using Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2:\nE = \u0394m * c^2\nE = 1.881e32 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.6929e49 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 9.5 solar masses is approximately 1.69e+49 J. \n\nHence, the closest answer to the correct one is:\nC. 1.69e+49 J",
