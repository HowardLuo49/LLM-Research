What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 9.5 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 104 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in the supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and v is the velocity. \n\nFirst, convert the masses from solar masses to kilograms:\nInitial mass = 104 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass\nInitial mass = 2.07256e32 kg\n\nRemnant mass = 9.5 solar masses * 1.989e30 kg/solar mass\nRemnant mass = 1.88955e31 kg\n\nNow, calculate the kinetic energy:\nKE = (1/2) * 1.88955e31 kg * (10000 km/s)^2\nKE = (1/2) * 1.88955e31 kg * (10000e3 m/s)^2\nKE = 9.44775e36 kg m^2/s^2\n\nTo convert to joules, we multiply by 1 J = 1 kg m^2/s^2:\nKE = 9.44775e36 J\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is option C. 1.69e+49 J.",
