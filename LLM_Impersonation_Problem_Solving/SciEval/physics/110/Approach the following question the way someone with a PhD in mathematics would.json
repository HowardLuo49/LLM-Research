    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for a black body spectrum. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\u03bb_max * T = constant\n\nwhere \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength, T is the temperature, and the constant is equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum, we can use Wien's displacement law to calculate the temperature T at which the radiation peaks. \n\nThe peak of the cosmic microwave background radiation spectrum corresponds to a wavelength of about 1 mm (10^-3 m), which is the same as the peak wavelength for a temperature of 2.73 K.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(\u03bb_max for T=2.73K)(2.73K) = (\u03bb_max for T=380,000 years after Big Bang)(T)\n\nSolving for T:\n\n(2.898 x 10^-3 m * 2.73 K) = (10^-3 m * T)\n\nT = (2.898 x 2.73) = 7.91254 K\n\nTherefore, the closest answer from the given choices is C. 6741.52 k.",
