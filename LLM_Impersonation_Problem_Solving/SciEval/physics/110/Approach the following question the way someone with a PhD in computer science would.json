    "gpt_response": "B. 2884.43 k\n\nTo calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for black body radiation. The wavelength corresponding to the peak intensity of the cosmic microwave background radiation can be calculated using the formula \u03bb_max = 2.9 mm * ((3.0029 K) / T), where \u03bb_max is the peak wavelength and T is the temperature. \n\nSince the universe was completely ionized at this time, the temperature can be calculated by equating the peak wavelength to the wavelength at which the CMB radiation intersects the black body spectrum. This gives us T = 2.9 mm * ((3.0029 K) / \u03bb_max). \n\nBy using the given T0 = 2.73 k, we can calculate \u03bb_max = 1 mm and T = 2884.43 k, which is closest to option B.",
