    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe was completely ionized, we can use the relations between the temperature and the redshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation. \n\nThe temperature of the universe at any given time can be related to the temperature today (T0 = 2.73 k) through the redshift factor (1 + z), where z is the redshift. For a completely ionized universe, the temperature is given by T = T0 * (1 + z). \n\nWe can use the relation between redshift and time for a matter-dominated universe to find the redshift at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This relation is given by z = (1 + 3285)/3285 * (t/380,000)^2/3 - 1, where t is the time after the Big Bang in years. \n\nPlugging in t = 380,000 years into the above equation, we can find the redshift. Then, using the redshift and the temperature today, we can calculate the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang. \n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is B. 2884.43 k.",
