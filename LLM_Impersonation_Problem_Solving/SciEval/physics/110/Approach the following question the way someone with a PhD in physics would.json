Calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, assuming that the universe was completely ionized at that time and that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : T0 = 2.73 k. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 3000.0 k\nB. 2884.43 k\nC. 6741.52 k\nD. 2504.73 k\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's displacement law, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated. \n\nThe energy density of the cosmic microwave background radiation at that time is given by Planck's radiation law, which is dependent on temperature and frequency. Since the radiation has a black body spectrum, it can be treated as a black body radiator.\n\nUsing Wien's displacement law, we can determine the peak wavelength of the radiation at that time. The peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. \n\nNext, we can use the relationship between the peak wavelength and temperature to calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 2884.43 k.",
