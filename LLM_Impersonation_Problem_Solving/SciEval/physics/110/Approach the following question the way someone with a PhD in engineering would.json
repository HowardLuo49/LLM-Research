    "gpt_response": "B. 2884.43 k\n\nTo calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of the radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature.\n\nFirst, we need to find the peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation using the formula:\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.9 mm K / T\n\nWhere:\n\u03bb_max = peak wavelength\n2.9 mm K = constant\nT = temperature of the radiation\n\nSince the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is much lower than the present temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (T0 = 2.73 K), we can assume that the peak wavelength at that time was much larger than it is today. Therefore, we can approximate that the universe was completely ionized when its temperature was roughly equal to the peak wavelength:\n\nT = \u03bb_max = 2.9 mm K / \u03bb_max\n\nSolving for T, we find:\n\nT = 2.9 mm K / 2.73 K \u2248 1.06 mm\n\nConverting this wavelength to temperature using the same formula, we get:\n\nT \u2248 2.9 mm K / 1.06 mm \u2248 2884.43 K\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 2884.43 K, which corresponds to option B.",
