What is the mass density of a filament of the cosmic web that is 788 megaparsecs in length and has an average thickness of 10 kiloparsecs? Given that the gas in the filament is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, calculate the number density of atoms in the filament assuming it is in thermal equilibrium.
