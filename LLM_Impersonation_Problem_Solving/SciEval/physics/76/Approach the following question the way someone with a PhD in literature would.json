What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 7.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 54 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and v is the velocity. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the masses from solar masses to kilograms:\nInitial mass = 54 solar masses = 54 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.073e32 kg\nRemnant mass = 7.7 solar masses = 7.7 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.531e31 kg\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the formula:\nKE = 0.5 * (1.531e31 kg) * (10,000,000 m/s)^2\nKE = 0.5 * (1.531e31 kg) * (1e8 m/s)^2\nKE = 0.5 * 1.531e31 kg * 1e16 m^2/s^2\nKE = 7.655e30 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the supernova explosion is approximately 7.655e30 J.\n\nLooking at the given options, the closest answer is:\nA. 1.35e+48 J.",
