What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 7.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 54 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 1.35e+48 J\nB. 1.21e+48 J\nC. 8.29e+48 J\nD. 5.73e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to find the initial kinetic energy, which is given by KE_initial = 0.5 * 54 * 1.989e30 * (10,000,000)^2. This gives us KE_initial = 2.6966e47 J.\n\nNext, we need to find the final kinetic energy, which is given by KE_final = 0.5 * 7.7 * 1.989e30 * (10,000,000)^2. This gives us KE_final = 3.0738805e46 J.\n\nThe total energy released in the supernova explosion is the difference between the initial and final kinetic energies: Total energy = KE_initial - KE_final = 2.6966e47 - 3.0738805e46 = 2.38921895e47 J.\n\nFrom the given choices, the closest answer is option B: 1.21e+48 J.",
