What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 7.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 54 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 1.35e+48 J\nB. 1.21e+48 J\nC. 8.29e+48 J\nD. 5.73e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the mass-energy equivalence principle, given by the famous equation E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass lost during the supernova explosion. This can be done by subtracting the remnant mass from the initial mass:\nMass lost = Initial mass - Remnant mass\nMass lost = 54 solar masses - 7.7 solar masses\nMass lost = 46.3 solar masses\n\nNext, we convert the mass lost into kilograms:\nMass lost = 46.3 solar masses x 1.989e30 kg/solar mass\nMass lost = 9.21e31 kg\n\nNow we can calculate the total energy released:\nEnergy released = Mass lost x (c^2)\nEnergy released = 9.21e31 kg x (3e8 m/s)^2\nEnergy released = 9.21e31 kg x 9e16 m^2/s^2\nEnergy released = 8.289e48 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 8.29e+48 J",
