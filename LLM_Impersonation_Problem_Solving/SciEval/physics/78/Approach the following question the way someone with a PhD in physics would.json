What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 106 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.19e+48 J\nB. 1.87e+49 J\nC. 5.13e+48 J\nD. 8.41e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for energy, E=mc^2, where E is the energy, m is the mass difference before and after the explosion, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe initial mass before the explosion is 10^6 solar masses, which is equivalent to 1.989e36 kg. After the explosion, the remnant has a mass of 1.7 solar masses, which is 1.7*1.989e30 = 3.3813e30 kg.\n\nTherefore, the mass difference is 1.989e36 kg - 3.3813e30 kg = 1.9856187e36 kg.\n\nPlugging in the values into the equation, we get:\nE = 1.9856187e36 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 1.78705683e55 J \n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is B. 1.87e+49 J.",
