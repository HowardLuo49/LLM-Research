What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 106 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.19e+48 J\nB. 1.87e+49 J\nC. 5.13e+48 J\nD. 8.41e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the initial and final masses to kilograms:\nInitial mass = 106 solar masses = 106 * 1.989e30 kg = 2.10774e32 kg\nFinal mass = 1.7 solar masses = 1.7 * 1.989e30 kg = 3.3813e30 kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the kinetic energy released:\nKE = 0.5 * (2.10774e32 - 3.3813e30) kg * (10,000 km/s)^2\nKE = 0.5 * 2.06963e32 kg * (10,000,000 m/s)^2\nKE = 1.034815e32 kg * 1e14 m^2/s^2\nKE = 1.034815e46 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the supernova explosion is approximately 1.034815e46 J, which is closest to option C: 5.13e+48 J.",
