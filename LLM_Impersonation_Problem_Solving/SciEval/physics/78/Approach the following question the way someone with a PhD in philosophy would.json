What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 1.7 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 106 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!\n\nA. 8.19e+48 J\nB. 1.87e+49 J\nC. 5.13e+48 J\nD. 8.41e+48 J\n\nAnswer:",
