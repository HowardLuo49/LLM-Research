The observed radial velocity of a star at that distance is 296 km/s, which is a combination of the star's actual rotational velocity and the velocity component along our line of sight.\n\nWe can calculate the tangential velocity (which is the rotational velocity we are interested in) using the observed radial velocity and the average rotational velocity of the galactic disk at that distance.
