Therefore, the distance from the center to the side is 3.0 m along the 6.0 m side and 3.5 m along the 7.0 m side. Using the formula, we get:\n\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 2) / (2 * 3.0) + (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 2) / (2 * 3.5)\nB = (2.52 * 10^(-6)) / 6 + (2.52 * 10^(-6)) / 7\nB = 4.2 * 10^(-7) + 3.6 * 10^(-7)\nB = 7.8 * 10^(-7) Tesla\n\nThe closest answer option is 8.97 x 10^(-7) Tesla (option A).",
