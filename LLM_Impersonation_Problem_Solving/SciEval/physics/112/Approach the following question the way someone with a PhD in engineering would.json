    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray of energy 5e+18 eV passing through a human body, we need to consider the cross-section of the body as it relates to the size of the cosmic ray. The cross-section of a typical human body can be approximated as A = 0.1 m^2.\n\nThe probability of interaction can be calculated using the formula for cross-section: P = A/s, where P is the probability, A is the area, and s is the physical size of the particle (in this case, the cosmic ray).\n\nGiven the energy of the cosmic ray as 5e+18 eV, we can convert this to Joules using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. Therefore, the energy of the cosmic ray is 8e-1 Joules.\n\nTo find the physical size of the cosmic ray, we can use the relationship between energy and mass for a relativistic particle: E = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. Since the momentum can be approximated as p = E/c, the physical size of the cosmic ray can be calculated as s = h/p, where h is the Planck constant.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get s = h/(E/c) = h*c/E. Calculate the size of the cosmic ray and then use it to find the probability of interaction.\n\nOnce we have the probability of interaction, we can estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body using the formula D = P*D, where D is the absorbed dose. The absorbed dose can be estimated using the energy of the cosmic ray and the absorption area.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, I believe the closest answer is:\n\nC. 3.78e-13 Gy",
