    "gpt_response": "To calculate the probability of a cosmic ray with energy 5e+18 eV passing through a human body, we need to consider the total energy of the cosmic ray and the energy required for ionization in the body.\n\nThe energy required for ionization in human tissue is approximately 34 eV. So, the number of ions produced when the cosmic ray passes through the body is given by: \nNumber of ions = Energy of cosmic ray / Energy for ionization \nNumber of ions = 5e+18 eV / 34 eV \n\nSince we are asked to estimate the dose of ionizing radiation received by the body, we need to consider the absorbed dose. The absorbed dose is given by:\n\nAbsorbed dose = Number of ions * Energy for ionization / Absorption area \nAbsorbed dose = (5e+18 eV / 34 eV) * 34 eV / 0.1 m^2 \nAbsorbed dose = 5e+17 Gy / 0.1 m^2 \nAbsorbed dose = 5e+18 Gy / m^2\n\nTherefore, the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation received by the body due to this cosmic ray is 5e+18 Gy / m^2 which is closest to option A. 1.55e-13 Gy.",
