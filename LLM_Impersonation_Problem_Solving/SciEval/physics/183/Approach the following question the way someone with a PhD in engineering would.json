    "gpt_response": "To calculate the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses, we can use the formula for the Schwarzschild radius: R = 2 * G * M / (c^2), where R is the event horizon radius, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the velocity of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: R = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 2 * 1.989e30 / (3e8)^2\n\nR = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 2 * 1.989e30 / 9e16\nR = 2 * 0.0000000006668 * 3.978e30 / 9e16\nR = 0.0000000026672 * 3.978e30 / 9e16\nR = 10.609e14 / 9e16\nR = 1.178e-2\n\nTherefore, the event horizon radius of a black hole with a mass of 2 solar masses is approximately 11.78 meters.\n\nThe closest option from the given choices is A. 5900 m, but the most accurate answer based on the calculations is not listed among the options.",
