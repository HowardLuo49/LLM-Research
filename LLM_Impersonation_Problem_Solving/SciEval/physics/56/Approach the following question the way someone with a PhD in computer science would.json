    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the expanding universe:\n\nT(t) = T0 / (1 + z)\n\nWhere:\nT(t) = Temperature of the universe at time t\nT0 = Present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation\nz = Redshift\n\nGiven that the present-day temperature is approximately 6.3 Kelvin and the age is 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to calculate the redshift z at that time. The redshift can be calculated using the formula:\n\n1 + z = (1 + z') / (1 + z'') = T(t') / T(t'')\n\nWhere:\nz' = Redshift at present time (t')\nT(t') = Present-day temperature\nt' = Present time\nt'' = 380,000 years after the Big Bang (given time)\nT(t'') = Temperature at the given time\n\nSolving for z:\n\n1 + z = 6.3 / T(t'')\n\nSince we have T(t') = 6.3 Kelvin, we need to find T(t''):\n\nT(t'') = 6.3 / (1 + z)\n\nNow, plug in the values and calculate:\n\nT(t'') = 6.3 / (1 + z)\nT(t'') = 6.3 / (1 + z) = 6.3 / (1 + 6.3 / T(t'')) = 6.3 / (1 + 6.3 / 6.3 / (1 + z)) = 6.3 / (1 + 6.3 / 1 + z)\nT(t'') = 6.3 / (1 + 6.3) = 6.3 / 7.3 = 0.863\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be approximately 0.863 Kelvin.\n\nAmong the given choices, none of them are close to the correct answer.",
