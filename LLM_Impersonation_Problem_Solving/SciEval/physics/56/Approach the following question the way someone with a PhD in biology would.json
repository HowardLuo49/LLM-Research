    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a function of the age of the universe. This formula takes into account the expansion of the universe and the cooling of the radiation.\n\nThe formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation at a given age t after the Big Bang is given by:\n\nT(t) = T0 / (1 + z)\nwhere T0 is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (6.3 Kelvin) and z is the redshift factor.\n\nThe redshift factor z at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang can be calculated using the formula:\n\nz = (t0 / t) - 1\nwhere t0 is the present age of the universe and t is the age of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nGiven that the present age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, we can calculate the redshift factor z and then substitute it into the first formula to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nUsing the given choices, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 3749.1 kelvin",
