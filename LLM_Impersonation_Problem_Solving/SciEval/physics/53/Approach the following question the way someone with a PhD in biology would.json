    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmic expansion. The temperature of the universe decreases as it expands. The relationship between the temperature and the age of the universe can be described by the equation T = T0 / (1 + z), where T is the temperature at the given age, T0 is the present-day temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (1.9 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor. \n\nAt an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the redshift factor z would be approximately 1090. Therefore, the temperature at that time would be T = 1.9 Kelvin / (1 + 1090) = 0.0017 Kelvin.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest answer is B. 2091.9 Kelvin.",
