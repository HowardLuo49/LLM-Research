    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmic time dilation. The temperature of the universe at a given time is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe at that time.\n\nSince the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is approximately 1.9 Kelvin today, we can estimate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula:\n\nT = To * (To/Tcmb) * (1+z)\n\nWhere:\nT = temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang\nTo = present-day temperature of CMB (1.9 Kelvin)\nTcmb = temperature of CMB at that time (unknown)\nz = redshift at that time\n\nWe know that the redshift z at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is approximately 1100. Therefore, plug in the values and solve for Tcmb:\n\nT = 1.9 * (1.9/Tcmb) * (1+1100)\nT = 1.9 * (1.9/Tcmb) * 1101\nT = 1.9 * 2091/Tcmb\n3800 = 2091/Tcmb\nTcmb = 2091/3800\nTcmb = 0.55 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is:\n\nB. 2091.9 kelvin",
