    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the formula for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a function of time since the Big Bang:\n\nT(t) = T0 * (1 + z)\n\nwhere T0 is the present-day temperature (1.9 Kelvin), and z is the redshift factor which is related to the age of the universe.\n\nGiven that the universe is 380,000 years old, we can calculate the redshift factor using the relation a(t) = 1 / (1 + z), where a(t) is the scale factor of the universe at time t. For a radiation-dominated universe, the scale factor is proportional to the square root of time, so a(t) = sqrt(t).\n\nPlugging in t = 380,000 years into the expression for the scale factor, we get:\n\na(380,000 years) = sqrt(380,000 years) = 617.2\n\nThen, we can calculate the redshift factor using a(t) = 1 / (1 + z):\n\n617.2 = 1 / (1 + z)\n1 + z = 1 / 617.2\nz \u2248 0.0016\n\nFinally, we can calculate the temperature of the universe at 380,000 years after the Big Bang using the formula:\n\nT(380,000 years) = 1.9 Kelvin * (1 + 0.0016)\nT(380,000 years) \u2248 1.90304 Kelvin\n\nTherefore, the closest option from the given choices is B. 2091.9 Kelvin.",
