    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use the concept of cosmic expansion and the relationship between temperature and the scale factor of the universe.\n\nThe temperature of the universe, T, is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe, a. This relationship is given by T \u221d 1/a. Therefore, if the cosmic microwave background radiation has a present-day temperature of 1.9 Kelvin, we can use the fact that the scale factor of the universe at present, a0, is 1, and the scale factor at an age of 380,000 years after the Big Bang, a380,000, is given by a380,000 = a0 / (age of universe at 380,000 years / present age of universe).\n\nThe present age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, or 13.8 x 10^9 years. Therefore, the scale factor at 380,000 years after the Big Bang is a380,000 = 1 / (13.8 x 10^9 / 380,000) = 1 / 36315.7895 \u2248 2.752 x 10^-5.\n\nNow, using the relationship T \u221d 1/a, we can calculate the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang as T380,000 = T0 * (a0 / a380,000) = 1.9 * (1 / 2.752 x 10^-5) \u2248 69056.82 Kelvin.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4761.2 kelvin",
