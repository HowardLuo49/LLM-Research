    "gpt_response": "To calculate the rotational period of the Milky Way's galactic halo, we can use the formula for calculating the period of an object in circular motion:\n\nT = 2 * \u03c0 * R / V\n\nwhere T is the period, R is the radius, and V is the velocity.\n\nGiven that the average radius of the Milky Way's galactic halo is 64866 light-years, we need to convert this to meters:\n64866 light-years * 9.461e15 meters/light-year = 6.13449626e20 meters\n\nWe also need to find the velocity. The velocity of light is given as c = 3e8 m/s. As the halo consists of stars and dark matter, we can assume its rotational speed is not much faster than the speed of light. Therefore, we can use this value as the velocity.\n\nNow we can plug the values into the formula:\n\nT = 2 * 3.14 * 6.13449626e20 / 3e8\nT = 3.848 * 10^12 / 3e8\nT = 1.28266666667 * 10^4 seconds\n\nTo convert this into years, we divide by the number of seconds in a year:\n1.28266666667 * 10^4 s / 3.154e7 s/year = 406.127342465 years\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is:\nC. 7.23e+08 years",
