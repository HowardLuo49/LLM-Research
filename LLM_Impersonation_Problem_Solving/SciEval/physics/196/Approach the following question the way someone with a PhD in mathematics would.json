    "gpt_response": "To calculate the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy, we can use the formula for the magnetic field generated by a rotating object, specifically the Biot-Savart law. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the angular velocity of the galaxy using the formula:\n\n\u03c9 = v / r\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular velocity, v is the rotational velocity (768 km/s), and r is the radius (50,000 light-years converted to km).\n\nr = 50,000 light-years = 4.7316 x 10^17 km\n\nSo, \u03c9 = 768 km/s / 4.7316 x 10^17 km \u2248 1.6212 x 10^-15 s^-1\n\nNext, we can use the Biot-Savart law to find the magnetic field:\n\nB = (\u03bc0 / (2\u03c0)) * (\u03c9 * r^2)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field, \u03bc0 is the permeability of free space, \u03c9 is the angular velocity we just calculated, and r is the radius.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB = (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 T m/A) / (2\u03c0) * (1.6212 x 10^-15 s^-1 * (4.7316 x 10^17 km)^2)\nB \u2248 8068 T\n\nTherefore, the value of the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy is approximately 8068 Tesla.\n\nCompared to a similar non-rotating galaxy, the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy would be stronger due to the contribution of the rotational motion.
