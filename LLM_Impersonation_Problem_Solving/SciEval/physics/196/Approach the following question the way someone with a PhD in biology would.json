    "gpt_response": "In order to calculate the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster, we can use the equation for the magnetic field in a galaxy with radius R and rotational velocity v given by B = (v * sqrt(R)) / c, where c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get B = (768 km/s * sqrt(50000 light-years)) / (3.00 x 10^5 km/s) = (768 km/s * 223.61 light-years) / (3.00 x 10^5 km/s) = 5832.48 light-years.\n\nTherefore, the value of the magnetic field in the galaxy located in the Virgo Cluster is approximately 5832 T. \n\nComparing this with a similar non-rotating galaxy, we can say that the magnetic field in the rotating galaxy is likely stronger due to the increased rotational velocity contributing to the magnetic field strength. \n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer from the given choices is:\n\nB. 8068 T",
