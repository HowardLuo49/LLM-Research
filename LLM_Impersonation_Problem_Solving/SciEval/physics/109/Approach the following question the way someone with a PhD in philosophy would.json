    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law for blackbody radiation. According to this law, the peak wavelength of radiation emitted by a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature. Since the universe was completely ionized at that time, it can be assumed that the cosmic microwave background radiation has a black body spectrum.\n\nWien's displacement law is given by:\n\n\u03bbmax * T = constant\n\nWhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength of radiation and T is the temperature of the blackbody.\n\nThe peak wavelength of the cosmic microwave background radiation is in the microwave region, corresponding to a temperature of about 2.73 k (T0).\n\n\u03bbmax * T0 = constant\n\nSince \u03bbmax is inversely proportional to T, we can say:\n\n\u03bbmax = a / T\n\nWhere 'a' is the constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, at 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature T1 of the universe can be calculated as follows:\n\n\u03bbmax * T1 = constant\n\na / T1 = constant\n\nTherefore:\n\nT1 = a / constant\n\nSubstitute T0 = 2.73 k into the equation a / T = constant:\n\nT1 = a / T0\n\nT1 = a / 2.73 k\n\nNow using the provided constants and calculations, we can find the closest option to the correct answer.",
