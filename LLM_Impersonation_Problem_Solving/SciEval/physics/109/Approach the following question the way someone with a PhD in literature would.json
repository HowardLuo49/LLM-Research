    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak of the black body spectrum is inversely proportional to the temperature. The formula for Wien's displacement law is \u03bbmax = b / T, where \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, b is a constant equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 mK, and T is the temperature.\n\nGiven that T0 = 2.73 K, we can use the relationship between the temperature at the time of observation and the temperature at the time we're interested in. The temperature of the universe at any given time (T) can be calculated using the formula T = T0 * (1+z), where z is the redshift factor. \n\nFirst, we calculate the redshift factor using the formula z = (T0/T)-1. Plugging in the values we have: z = (2.73 K / T) - 1. At 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was approximately 1100 times smaller and hotter, so z would be approximately 1099. \n\nNow, using the redshift factor, we can calculate the temperature at that time: T = 2.73 K * (1+1099) = 3002.73 K. The closest option to this calculated temperature is D. 3000.0 K.",
