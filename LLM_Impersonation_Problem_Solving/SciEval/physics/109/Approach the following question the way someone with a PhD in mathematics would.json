    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we need to use the relationship between the energy density of radiation and temperature in a black body spectrum. The formula for the energy density of radiation is given by \u03c1 = aT^4, where a is the radiation constant.\n\nAt 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was completely ionized, meaning it was filled with radiation. This radiation has a black body spectrum, so we can use the formula above to relate the energy density of radiation to the temperature. \n\nSince the universe was filled with radiation at that time, we can equate the energy density of radiation to the energy density of the cosmic microwave background radiation at present, which is T0 = 2.73 K.\n\nTherefore, we have aT^4 = aT0^4\n\nSolving for T, we get T = T0 * (380,000 years)^(1/2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get T = 2.73 K * (\u221a380,000) = 2.73 K * 617.21 \u2248 1684.5 K\n\nThe closest answer choice is D. 3000.0 K.",
