    "gpt_response": "To calculate the temperature of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang, we can use Wien's displacement law which states that the peak wavelength of a black body spectrum is inversely proportional to its temperature. The equation for this relationship is:\n\n\u03bbmax = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bbmax is the peak wavelength, b is Wien's displacement constant, and T is the temperature. The value of b is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nGiven that the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation is T0 = 2.73 K, we can use the fact that the temperature of a black body spectrum decreases inversely with the scale factor of the universe to find the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang.\n\nThe scale factor at that time, a, is given by:\n\na = (time after Big Bang) ^ (1/2)\n\nTherefore, the temperature at 380,000 years after the Big Bang would be:\n\nT = T0 / a\n\nT = 2.73 K / (sqrt(380,000))\n\nT = 2.73 K / 616.198\n\nT = 0.004438 K\n\nThis is the temperature units of T/To. To find the final temperature in Kelvins, we multiply by T0:\n\nT = 0.004438 K * 2.73 K\n\nT = 0.012 K\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is D. 3000.0 K.",
