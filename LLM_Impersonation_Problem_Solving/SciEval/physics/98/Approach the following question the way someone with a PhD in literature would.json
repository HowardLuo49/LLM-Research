In a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, stars and other objects orbit around the galactic center due to the gravitational forces present in the galactic disk.\n\nThe observed radial velocity of a star at a distance of 33136 light-years from the galactic center is given as 210 km/s. Radial velocity is the component of velocity along the line of sight from the observer to the object. The average rotational velocity of the galactic disk at that distance is given as 282 km/s. Rotational velocity is the component of velocity perpendicular to the line of sight.\n\nUsing these values, we can apply the principle of vector addition to find the total velocity of the star. This can be done using the formula:\n\nTotal Velocity = sqrt( Radial Velocity^2 + Rotational Velocity^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nTotal Velocity = sqrt(210^2 + 282^2)\nTotal Velocity = sqrt(44200 + 79524)\nTotal Velocity = sqrt(123724)\nTotal Velocity = 351.48 km/s\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is:\n\nB. 204.27 km/s",
