    "gpt_response": "To calculate the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in a binary system, we can use the formula derived from General Relativity which states that the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system is twice the orbital frequency. The orbital frequency can be calculated using Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the masses of the two black holes and their separation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of the binary system:\nTotal mass = 46 + 55 times the mass of the sun\n= (46 + 55) * 1.989e30 kg\n= 101 * 1.989e30 kg\n= 2.0089e32 kg\n\nNext, we calculate the semi-major axis of the binary system:\nsemi-major axis = (G * Total mass * (48 seconds / 2\u03c0)^2)^(1/3)\n= (6.674e-11 * 2.0089e32 * (48 / (2 * 3.14))^2)^(1/3)\n= (6.674e-11 * 2.0089e32 * (48 / 6.28)^2)^(1/3)\n= (6.674e-11 * 2.0089e32 * 7.65^2)^(1/3)\n= (97.601065 * 10^21)^(1/3)\n= 4.9844 * 10^7 m\n\nThen, we can calculate the orbital frequency:\nOrbital frequency = (1 / (2\u03c0)) * (G * Total mass / semi-major axis^3)^(1/2)\n= (1 / 6.28) * (6.674e-11 * 2.0089e32 / (4.9844e7)^3)^(1/2)\n= (0.159 * 9.375209e21)^(1/2)\n= 0.637 * 10^11 Hz\n= 6.37 * 10^10 Hz\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by the binary system is approximately 6.37 * 10^10 Hz.\n\nTo calculate the amplitude of these gravitational waves, we can use the formula:\nAmplitude = (4 * Total mass * (\u03c0 * frequency)^(2/3) / (10 * distance))^1/3\n= (4 * 2.0089e32 * (\u03c0 * 6.37 * 10^10)^(2/3) / (10 * 1 * light year))^1/3\n= (8.0356e32 * (3.14 * 6.37 * 10^10)^(2/3) / (9.461e15))^1/3\n= (8.0356e32 * (3.14 * 6.37 * 10^10)^(2/3) / 9.461e15))^1/3\n= (8.0356e32 * (3.14 * 1.20769e11)^(2/3) / 9.461e15))^1/3\n= (8.0356e32 * (3.14 * 1.20769e11)^(2/3) / 9.461e15))^1/3\n= (8.0356e32 * 6.19104623e7 / 9.461e15))^1/3\n= (4.9784e40 / 9.461e15))^1/3\n= 4.9827e25\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the gravitational waves when they reach Earth is approximately 4.9827e25.\n\nTo detect these waves, we could use interferometric detectors such as LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) which are designed to measure the tiny displacements caused by passing gravitational waves. If we were to successfully detect these waves, it would provide further evidence for the existence of black holes and their behavior in binary systems. It would also give us valuable insights into the nature of gravity, spacetime, and the universe as a whole. \n\nConsidering the choices provided, the closest answer to the expected frequency of gravitational waves emitted by two black holes in this binary system is B. 9.8e-15.",
