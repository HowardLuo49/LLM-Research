What is the total energy released in a supernova explosion that results in a remnant with a mass of 2.3 solar masses, assuming an initial mass of 62 solar masses and a velocity of 10,000 km/s? Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we can use the equation for kinetic energy: KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the remnant and v is the velocity. \n\nFirst, convert the solar masses and velocity to kilograms and meters per second:\n- Initial mass: 62 solar masses = 62 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.23218e32 kg\n- Remnant mass: 2.3 solar masses = 2.3 * 1.989e30 kg = 4.5767e30 kg\n- Velocity: 10,000 km/s = 10,000 * 1000 = 1.0e7 m/s\n\nNow, calculate the kinetic energy released:\nKE = 0.5 * 4.5767e30 kg * (1.0e7 m/s)^2 = 2.28835e37 J\n\nThe total energy released also includes the rest energy of the remnant, which can be calculated using Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2:\nE = 4.5767e30 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 4.11803e47 J\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the supernova explosion would be approximately 4.11803e47 J + 2.28835e37 J = 4.140318e47 J, which is closest to option B: 1.07e+49 J.",
