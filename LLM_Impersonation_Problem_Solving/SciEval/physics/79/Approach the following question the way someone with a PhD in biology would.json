    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in a supernova explosion, we first need to determine the total initial energy of the system before the explosion. The total initial energy (E) is given by the formula:\n\nE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the object (initial mass of the star) = 62 solar masses = 62 * 1.989e30 kg\nv = velocity of the object = 10,000 km/s = 10,000 * 1000 m/s\n\nCalculating the initial energy:\nm = 62 * 1.989e30 kg = 1.23118e32 kg\nv = 10,000 * 1000 m/s = 1.0e7 m/s\nE = 0.5 * 1.23118e32 kg * (1.0e7 m/s)^2\nE = 0.5 * 1.23118e32 kg * 1.0e14 m^2/s^2\nE = 6.1559e45 J\n\nNext, we have the total final energy after the supernova explosion. This energy is the sum of the remnant mass energy and the kinetic energy of the remnant. The total energy (Ef) is given by the formula:\n\nEf = (mc^2) + 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the remnant = 2.3 solar masses = 2.3 * 1.989e30 kg\n\nCalculating the total final energy:\nm = 2.3 * 1.989e30 kg = 4.5727e30 kg\nEf = ((4.5727e30 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2) + (0.5 * 4.5727e30 kg * (1.0e7 m/s)^2)\nEf = ((4.5727e30 kg) * 9e16 m^2/s^2) + (0.5 * 4.5727e30 kg * 1.0e14 m^2/s^2)\nEf = 4.11543e47 J + 2.28635e45 J\nEf = 4.34407e47 J\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total energy released in the supernova explosion by taking the difference between the initial and final energies:\n\nEnergy released = E - Ef\nEnergy released = 6.1559e45 J - 4.34407e47 J\nEnergy released = -4.32851e47 J\n\nSince the energy released is negative, it means that energy was absorbed during the supernova. \nConsidering the answer choices provided, the closest option to the calculated result is:\n\nD. 4.38e+48 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.38e+48 J.",
