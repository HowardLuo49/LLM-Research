Calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole with a mass of 3 solar masses, a radius of 49 kilometers, and an accretion rate of 0.6 solar masses per year. Assume the disk is made of gas that is 10% hydrogen and 90% helium and has a temperature of 10 million Kelvin. Please note that the following content involves constants might be used in the calculations : gravitation constant : G = 6.674e-11 N\u00b7m^2/kg^2 ; solar mass = 1.989e30 kg ; velocity of light: c = 3e8 m/s.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total energy released in the accretion disk of a black hole, we can use the formula for luminosity of an accretion disk: \n\nLuminosity = (eta * mc^2) = 0.1 * (1-eta) * M * c^2\n\nWhere eta is the efficiency of converting mass into energy (assumed to be 0.1 for this problem), M is the mass accretion rate, and c is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the mass accretion rate converted from solar masses per year to kg per second:\nM = 0.6 * M_sun / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 0.6 * 1.989e30 kg / 3.15576e7 s = 3.78e22 kg/s\n\nNext, we can calculate the luminosity using the given formula:\nLuminosity = 0.1 * (1-0.1) * 3 * 1.989e30 * (3e8)^2 = 0.9 * 3 * 1.989e30 * 9e16 = 5.363e48 W\n\nFinally, the total energy released over a year can be calculated by integrating the luminosity over time, which equals the luminosity multiplied by the number of seconds in a year:\nEnergy = Luminosity * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60\n\nPlugging in the values:\nEnergy = 5.363e48 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 1.687e56 J\n\nThe closest option to the correct answer is therefore A. 9.91e+38 J.",
