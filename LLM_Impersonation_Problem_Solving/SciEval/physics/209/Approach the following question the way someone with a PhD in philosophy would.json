Determine the  magnetic field strength at a distance of 5  cm from a straight wire carrying a current of 4 A. The wire has a length of 5 cm, and the current flows in the direction perpendicular to the wire. Additionally, please select the option from the given choices that you believe is closest to the correct answer!

Ampere's Law states that the magnetic field strength, B, around a current-carrying wire is directly proportional to the current, I, and inversely proportional to the distance from the wire, r. \n\nUsing the formula B = (\\mu_0 * I) / (2\u03c0r), where \\mu_0 is the permeability of free space (1.26 * 10^(-6) V\u00b7s/(A\u00b7m)), I is the current (4 A), and r is the distance from the wire (5 cm = 0.05 m), we can calculate the magnetic field strength at a distance of 5 cm from the wire.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nB = (1.26 * 10^(-6) * 4) / (2\u03c0*0.05)\nB = (5.04 * 10^(-6)) / (0.314)\nB = 16.05 * 10^(-6) Tesla\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the correct answer is A. 16.0 x 10^(-6) Tesla.",
