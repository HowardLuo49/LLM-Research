At the present time, the temperature of the universe (i.e., the microwave radiation background) is about 3 K. When the temperature was 12 K, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were\nA: one-quarter as distant as they are today\nB: one-half as distant as they are today\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today\nD: two times as distant as they are today",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to answer the question, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and the expansion of the universe. The temperature of the universe is related to its scale factor, representing the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the temperature decreases.\n\nWhen the temperature of the universe was 12 K, this corresponds to an earlier time when the universe was more compact and denser. As the universe expands, galaxies move away from each other. The scale factor of the universe at 12 K would have been smaller than it is at 3 K.\n\nTherefore, at 12 K, galaxies would have been closer together compared to their current distances at 3 K. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today",
