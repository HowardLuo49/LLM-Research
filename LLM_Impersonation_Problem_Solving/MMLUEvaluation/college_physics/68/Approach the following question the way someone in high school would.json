At the present time, the temperature of the universe (i.e., the microwave radiation background) is about 3 K. When the temperature was 12 K, typical objects in the universe, such as galaxies, were\nA: one-quarter as distant as they are today\nB: one-half as distant as they are today\nC: separated by about the same distances as they are today\nD: two times as distant as they are today",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if the temperature of the universe is now 3 K and it was 12 K before, I think that means it was hotter back then. And if things were hotter back then, maybe everything was closer together? So, I guess that means galaxies were probably closer together back when the temperature was 12 K. So, I would say that the answer is probably A: one-quarter as distant as they are today.",
