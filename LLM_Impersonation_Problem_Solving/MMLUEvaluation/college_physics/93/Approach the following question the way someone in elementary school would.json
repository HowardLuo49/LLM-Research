Under certain conditions, a beam of electrons impinging on a crystal surface will diffract and a scattering pattern of the beam can be obtained. What is the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed in order to see the pattern? (Assume the lattice spacing of the crystal to be 0.4 nm.)\nA: 0.1 eV\nB: 1 eV\nC: 10 eV\nD: 100 eV",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well when electrons hit a crystal surface, they make a pattern called diffraction. To see this pattern, the electrons need to have enough kinetic energy. Let's see, the lattice spacing of the crystal is 0.4 nm. To see the pattern, the electrons need to have an energy of about 1 eV. So, the answer is B: 1 eV!",
