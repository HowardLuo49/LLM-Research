Under certain conditions, a beam of electrons impinging on a crystal surface will diffract and a scattering pattern of the beam can be obtained.

To make this pattern, the electrons need to have some special energy. Hmm... I think it's not too much energy, maybe just a tiny bit! Let's see... How about 0.1 eV? Yay, I did it!",
