    "gpt_response": "Hey guys, so we're talking about electric displacement current through a surface here. So remember, electric displacement current is kind of like the flow of electric field through a surface. \nNow, the question is asking us what the electric displacement current through a surface is proportional to. \nA. The magnetic flux through S - that doesn't really make sense because we're talking about electric displacement current, not magnetic stuff.\nB. The rate of change of the magnetic flux through S - hmm, this could make sense since electric displacement current involves changing electric fields.\nC. The time integral of the magnetic flux through S - nah, that's not really what electric displacement current is all about.\nD. The rate of change of the electric flux through S - this sounds more like it! Electric displacement current should be related to changes in electric flux, right?\nSo, my final answer is D: rate of change of the electric flux through S.",
