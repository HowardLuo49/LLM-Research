    "gpt_response": "In the diamond structure of elemental carbon, each carbon atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbors placed at the corners of a tetrahedron. This is because the carbon atoms in a diamond lattice are bonded to four other carbon atoms through sp\u00b3 hybridization, resulting in a tetrahedral arrangement of bonds around each carbon atom. Therefore, the correct answer is D: tetrahedron.",
