    "gpt_response": "OK, so we know the total energy is 5.0 GeV and the momentum is 4.9 GeV/c. We can use the equation for total energy: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m0c^2)^2. \n\nPlugging in the values we have, we get: (5.0 GeV)^2 = (4.9 GeV/c)^2 + (m0c^2)^2.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for the rest mass m0, we get: (m0c^2)^2 = (5.0 GeV)^2 - (4.9 GeV/c)^2.\n\nCalculating this gives us: (m0c^2)^2 = 25 - 24.01 = 0.99.\n\nTaking the square root of 0.99 to find the rest mass m0, we get: m0 = sqrt(0.99) \u2248 1.0 GeV/c^2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 1.0 GeV/c^2.",
