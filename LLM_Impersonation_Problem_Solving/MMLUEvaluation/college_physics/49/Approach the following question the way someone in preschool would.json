    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's have some fun with this question! So we have a particle with 5.0 GeV of total energy and momentum of 4.9 GeV/c. To find the rest mass, we need to do a little math. The formula for the total energy of a particle is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, where E is the total energy, p is the momentum, m is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nLet's first plug in the values we have: 5.0 GeV for total energy and 4.9 GeV/c for momentum. We'll let c^2 = 1 for simplicity. So the equation becomes (5)^2 = (4.9)^2 + (m)^2.\n\nNow we just need to solve for m, the rest mass. By rearranging the equation, we get m^2 = (5)^2 - (4.9)^2 = 25 - 24.01 = 0.99.\n\nThe square root of 0.99 is approximately 0.9965. But since we're in preschool and just learning about rounding, let's round that to the nearest tenth. So the rest mass is approximately 1.0 GeV/c^2, which corresponds to option D. Yay, we did it!",
