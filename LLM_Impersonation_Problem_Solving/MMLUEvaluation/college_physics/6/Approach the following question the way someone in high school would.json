    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. Consider three identical, ideal capacitors. The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\nA: V_0/5\nB: V_0/3\nC: V_0/2\nD: 2V_0/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "I remember learning about capacitors in my physics class. When capacitors are connected in series, the total voltage across them is divided among the capacitors. Since the three capacitors are identical and in series, the final voltage on the first capacitor should be V_0/3. So, my answer is B: V_0/3.",
