The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\nA: V_0/5\nB: V_0/3\nC: V_0/2\nD: 2V_0/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's imagine we have three special buckets called capacitors. The first bucket is full of water, which we can think of as charged up with voltage. Then we disconnect it from the hose that fills it up. The other two buckets are empty and connected in a line. When we connect these two empty buckets across the first bucket, some of the water from the first bucket will flow into the other two buckets.\n\nSince all the buckets are the same size, we can imagine that the water will divide equally between them. This means that each of the other two buckets will end up with the same amount of water, which is like saying they will end up with the same voltage.\n\nSo, if we think about it like this, the final voltage on the first capacitor will be V_0 divided by 3, which is answer choice B.",
