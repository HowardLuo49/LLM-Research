At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we know the box is 10 kg and it's going 1 m/s. Then a force is applied and it goes 5 m with a speed of 2 m/s. We need to find the force. \n\nOk, so to find the force we can use the equation force = mass x acceleration. We know the mass is 10 kg, but we need to find the acceleration. We can use the equation acceleration = change in velocity/change in time. \n\nFirst we find the change in velocity. The initial velocity is 1 m/s and the final velocity is 2 m/s, so the change in velocity is 2 m/s - 1 m/s = 1 m/s. \n\nNext we need to find the change in time. We know the box travels 5 m with the constant force applied, so we can use the equation distance = 1/2 x acceleration x time^2. We know the distance is 5 m, so we can rearrange the equation to solve for time. \n\nNow we have all the information we need to find the force. Let's find the right answer! \n\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N\n\nThe correct answer is C: 3 N.",
