At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can use the equation:\n\nForce x Distance = Change in Kinetic Energy\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(1 m/s)^2 = 5 J\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(10 kg)(2 m/s)^2 = 20 J\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nSince the box traveled 5 m with the constant force applied, we can calculate the work done by the force using this equation:\n\nWork = Force x Distance\n\n15 J = Force x 5 m\n\nForce = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which is option C.",
