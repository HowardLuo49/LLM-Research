At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The box was sliding without any force at first, just going along. Then a force was applied and it went 5 meters. Then the force was taken away and it kept going, but faster. So, I think the force must have made it speed up. I remember that more force makes things speed up more. So, I think the force must be bigger than 1 N or 2 N. Maybe it's 3 N or 4 N? I think it's 4 N because that's even bigger and would make the box go faster. So, my answer is D: 4 N.",
