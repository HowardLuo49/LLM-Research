Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",

    "gpt_response": "First, let's imagine we're dropping a bouncy ball on the ground and watching it bounce up! Whee! But now we're going to do some serious science stuff. So, when we drop the ball, we measure how fast it's going just before it hits the ground. And we found out that we're not super sure about the speed because sometimes we're a little off. Like, maybe we say it's going 10 mph, but actually it's going 11 mph. So, our uncertainty is 10 percent.\n\nNow, what about the kinetic energy of the ball? That's like how much energy it has when it's moving. And we want to know how much our uncertainty in the speed changes the energy. If our uncertainty in the speed is 10 percent, then our uncertainty in the kinetic energy will be... B: 10%! Yay, we did science!",
