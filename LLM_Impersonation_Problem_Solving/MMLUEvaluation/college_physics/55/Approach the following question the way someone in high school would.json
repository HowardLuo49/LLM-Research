Two students perform an experiment in which they drop a ball from rest from a known height above the ground and measure the speed of the ball just before it strikes the ground. From repeated measurement, the students estimate the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball to be 10 percent. Which of the following gives the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball? (Assume the uncertainty in the ball\u2019s mass is negligibly small.)\nA: 5%\nB: 10%\nC: 15%\nD: 20%",

    "gpt_response": "So, the question is asking us to find the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball based on the uncertainty in the measured speed. The given uncertainty in the measured speed is 10%.\n\nTo find the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, we can use the formula for kinetic energy:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nSince the uncertainty in the mass is negligibly small, we only need to consider the uncertainty in the speed. Let's assume the speed of the ball is v, and the uncertainty in the speed is 10% of v, which is 0.1v.\n\nNow, let's calculate the uncertainty in the kinetic energy:\n\nKE_upper = 0.5 * m * (v + 0.1v)^2 = 0.5 * m * (1.1v)^2 = 0.5 * 1.21 * m * v^2 = 1.21 * KE\n\nKE_lower = 0.5 * m * (v - 0.1v)^2 = 0.5 * m * (0.9v)^2 = 0.5 * 0.81 * m * v^2 = 0.81 * KE\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is:\n\n(KE_upper - KE_lower)/2KE * 100% = (1.21 - 0.81)/2 * 100% = 0.4 * 100% = 20%\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 20%.",
