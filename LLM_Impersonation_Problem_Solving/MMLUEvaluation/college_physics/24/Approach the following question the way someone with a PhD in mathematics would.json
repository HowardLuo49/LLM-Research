The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring which of the following properties?\nA: Magnetic susceptibility\nB: Hall coefficient\nC: Electrical resistivity\nD: Thermal conductivity",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, one would typically measure the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a key parameter that characterizes the type of charge carriers in a material. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the current flow in the material and measuring the resulting Hall voltage, one can determine whether the charge carriers are predominantly electrons (negative) or holes (positive). This information is crucial for understanding the electrical behavior of the semiconductor and designing electronic devices based on it. Other properties such as magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity may provide additional information about the material but are not as directly related to determining the sign of the charge carriers.",
