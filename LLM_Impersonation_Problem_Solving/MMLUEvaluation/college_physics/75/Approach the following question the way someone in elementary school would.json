The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because\nA: electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do\nB: the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium\nC: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\nD: electrons in metals are highly relativistic",
