The mean kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in metals is ordinarily much higher than kT because\nA: electrons have many more degrees of freedom than atoms do\nB: the electrons and the lattice are not in thermal equilibrium\nC: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas\nD: electrons in metals are highly relativistic",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is C: the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas. This is because in metals, the electrons are free to move and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which leads to a degenerate Fermi gas where the electrons have high kinetic energy.",
