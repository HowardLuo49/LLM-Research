The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the Doppler effect equation for sound waves:\n\nf' = f * (v + vD) / (v + vs)\n\nWhere:\nf' = frequency of the echo\nf = frequency of the siren\nv = speed of sound\nvD = speed of the car\nvs = speed of the source of the sound producing the echo\n\nPlugging in the given values:\nf' = 600 Hz * (350 m/s + 3.5 m/s) / (350 m/s - 3.5 m/s)\nf' = 600 Hz * 353.5 m/s / 346.5 m/s\nf' = 611.64 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency closest to 612 Hz, which is answer choice C.",
