The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Oh boy, the police car is going fast! Vroom vroom! The siren is making a sound at 600 Hz. The sound bounces off the wall and comes back to the car. But because the car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves get squished together, so the driver hears a higher frequency. Which one is closest? Hmm...I think it's B: 606 Hz! Yay, we figured it out!",
