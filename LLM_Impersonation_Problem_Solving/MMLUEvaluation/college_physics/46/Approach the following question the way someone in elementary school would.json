The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 600 Hz\nB: 606 Hz\nC: 612 Hz\nD: 618 Hz",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay class, so let's try to solve this problem together. The police car is moving towards a wall, and the siren is making a sound at a frequency of 600 Hz. The speed of sound is 350 m/s. \n\nWhen the siren makes a sound and it reaches the wall, the sound bounces off the wall and comes back to the car. This is called an echo. \n\nBecause the car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves from the siren will be squished together, making the frequency higher. We need to figure out how much higher the frequency will be when the sound waves come back to the car.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula: \napparent frequency = actual frequency * (speed of sound / (speed of sound - speed of car))\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get: \napparent frequency = 600 Hz * (350 m/s / (350 m/s - 3.5 m/s))\n\nCalculating that out, we get an apparent frequency closest to 612 Hz, which is answer C. Great job everyone!",
