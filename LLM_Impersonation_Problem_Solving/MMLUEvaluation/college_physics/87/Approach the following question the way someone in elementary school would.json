Unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers whose transmission axes make an angle of 45q with each other. The transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is what percentage of the incident intensity?\nA: 100%\nB: 75%\nC: 50%\nD: 25%",

    "gpt_response": "Ok class, so imagine the light is like a bunch of tiny arrows pointing in different directions. When the light goes through the first polarizer, it only lets some of the arrows through because they are all lined up a certain way. Then, when the light goes through the second polarizer that is at an angle, even fewer arrows can get through because they need to be lined up just right. So, the intensity of the light that gets through both polarizers is 25% of the original intensity. That means the answer is D: 25%!",
