Let's think about it like this - if something is happening in a reversible way, it's like we can go back and forth and nothing gets messed up. It's like magic!\n\nNow, let's think about our choices. A) says there are no changes in the internal energy of the system. B) says the temperature stays the same. C) says the entropy of the system and its environment doesn't change. D) says the entropy has to increase.\n\nWell, if something is happening all nice and smoothly like in a reversible process, then the changes should be all happy and balanced. So, I think the right choice is C) The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged. Yay for reversible magic processes!",
