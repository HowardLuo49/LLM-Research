So, to find the speed the observer needs to move at, I can rearrange the formula to solve for velocity.\n\nThe formula is: L' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nNow, I can plug in the values: L' = 0.80 m, L = 1.00 m\n\n0.80 = 1.00 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n0.80 = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\n0.64 = 1 - v^2/c^2 \n\nv^2/c^2 = 0.36\n\nv = 0.60c\n\nSo, B: 0.60c is the correct answer.",
