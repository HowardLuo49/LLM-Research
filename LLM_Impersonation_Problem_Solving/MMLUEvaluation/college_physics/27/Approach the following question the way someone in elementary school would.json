    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this question is a little tricky, but let's break it down. The rod is 1.00m in its own rest system, but the observer is moving parallel to the rod. So, if the observer measures the rod to be 0.80m, that means the rod is shorter to the observer because of the movement. To figure out how fast the observer is moving, we can use the formula for length contraction, which is:\n\nL' = L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\nL' is the observed length\nL is the rest length\nv is the speed of the observer\nc is the speed of light\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n0.80m = 1.00m * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSolving for v/c:\n0.80/1 = sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n0.80^2 = 1 - v^2/c^2\n0.64 = 1 - v^2/c^2\nv^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.64\nv^2/c^2 = 0.36\nv/c = sqrt(0.36)\nv/c = 0.60\n\nSo, the observer must be moving at 0.60c to measure the rod's length as 0.80m. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 0.60c.",
