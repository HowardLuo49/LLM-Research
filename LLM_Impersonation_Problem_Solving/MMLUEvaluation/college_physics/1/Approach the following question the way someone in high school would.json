    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. White light is normally incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33). A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "So, we know that when white light hits the interface between the water and oil, some of it will be reflected and some will be transmitted through. The amount of reflection depends on the index of refraction of the materials and the angle of incidence.\n\nSince the oil has a higher index of refraction than the water, there will be a strong reflection of light at the interface. The amount of reflection will also depend on the wavelength of the incident light.\n\nIn this case, the most strongly reflected wavelength of light will be the one that is most closely matched to the thickness of the oil layer (500 nm). This is known as the first-order constructive interference condition and is given by:\n\n2 * n * d * cos(theta) = m * lambda.\n\nWhere:\n- n = index of refraction of the oil,\n- d = thickness of the oil layer,\n- theta = angle of incidence,\n- m = order of interference (in this case, 1),\n- lambda = wavelength of light.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = 1 * lambda,\nlambda = 500 nm.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is A: 500 nm.",
