A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hey there! So, when light goes from air to water, it can change direction because of something called refraction. And when it hits the thin layer of oil on top of the water, some of it gets reflected back. The reflected light waves interfere with each other, and some wavelengths get cancelled out while others get reinforced. Since the oil has a higher index of refraction than water, the most strongly reflected wavelength will be the one that experiences constructive interference. In this case, since the oil layer is 500 nm thick, the most strongly reflected wavelength will be 500 nm. So the answer is A: 500 nm.",
