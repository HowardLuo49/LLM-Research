An astronomer observes a very small moon orbiting a planet and measures the moon\u2019s minimum and maximum distances from the planet\u2019s center and the moon\u2019s maximum orbital speed. Which of the following CANNOT be calculated from these measurements?\nA: Mass of the moon\nB: Mass of the planet\nC: Minimum speed of the moon\nD: Period of the orbit",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so an astronomer is looking at a little moon going around a big planet. They measure how far the moon is from the center of the planet at its closest and farthest points, and how fast it's going at its fastest. They want to know what they can't figure out with these measurements.\nA: They can probably figure out the mass of the moon because they know how fast it's going and how far away it is.\nB: They might be able to figure out the mass of the planet too, since they know how far the moon is and how fast it's going.\nC: They can't figure out the minimum speed of the moon with just these measurements.\nD: They might be able to figure out the period of the moon's orbit, since they know how far away it is and how fast it's going. \n\nSo, the answer is C: Minimum speed of the moon.",
