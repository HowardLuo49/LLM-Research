The primary source of the Sun\u2019s energy is a series of thermonuclear reactions in which the energy produced is c^2 times the mass difference between\nA: two hydrogen atoms and one helium atom\nB: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom\nC: six hydrogen atoms and two helium atoms\nD: three helium atoms and one carbon atom",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer would be B: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom. This is because during the process of nuclear fusion in the Sun, four hydrogen atoms combine to form one helium atom, releasing a large amount of energy in the process.",
