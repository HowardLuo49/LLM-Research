    "gpt_response": "As a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first recognizing the concept of mass-energy equivalence as described by Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2. This equation states that the energy (E) produced in a reaction is equal to the mass (m) difference times the speed of light (c) squared.\n\nNext, I would analyze the given choices in terms of the mass difference between the reactants and products in each reaction. In this case, we are dealing with nuclear reactions involving hydrogen and helium atoms. The correct choice will be the one where the mass difference between the reactants and products is greatest.\n\nUpon careful examination, I can determine that option B: four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom has the greatest mass difference compared to the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
