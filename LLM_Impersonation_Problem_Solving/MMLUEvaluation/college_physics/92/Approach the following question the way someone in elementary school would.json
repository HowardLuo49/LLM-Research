When a 300-volt potential difference is applied across this combination, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is\nA: 0.09 J\nB: 0.18 J\nC: 0.27 J\nD: 0.41 J",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to add up the capacitance of the two capacitors which is 3 + 6 = 9 microfarads. Then, we use the formula energy = 0.5 * capacitance * voltage^2. Plugging in the numbers, we get 0.5 * 9 * 300^2 = 0.41 J. So, the answer is D: 0.41 J.",
