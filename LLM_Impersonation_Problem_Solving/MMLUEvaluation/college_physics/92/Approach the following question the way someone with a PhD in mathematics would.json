When a 300-volt potential difference is applied across this combination, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is\nA: 0.09 J\nB: 0.18 J\nC: 0.27 J\nD: 0.41 J",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total energy stored in the capacitors, we first need to calculate the total capacitance of the series combination. The total capacitance for capacitors in series is given by the formula:\n\n1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2\n\nWhere C1 and C2 are the capacitances of the individual capacitors.
