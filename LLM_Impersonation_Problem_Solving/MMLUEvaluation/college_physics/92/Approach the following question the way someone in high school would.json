When a 300-volt potential difference is applied across this combination, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is\nA: 0.09 J\nB: 0.18 J\nC: 0.27 J\nD: 0.41 J",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have two capacitors connected in series and a potential difference of 300 volts applied. To find the total energy stored in the capacitors, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy = 0.5 * C * V^2\n\nFirst, let's find the equivalent capacitance of the two capacitors connected in series. The formula for capacitors in series is:\n\n1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n1/C_total = 1/3 + 1/6\n1/C_total = 2/6 + 1/6\n1/C_total = 3/6\nC_total = 6/3\nC_total = 2 microfarads\n\nNow, plug in the values into the energy formula:\n\nEnergy = 0.5 * 2 * (300)^2\nEnergy = 0.5 * 2 * 90000\nEnergy = 90000\n\nSo, the total energy stored in the two capacitors is 0.09 J (option A).",
