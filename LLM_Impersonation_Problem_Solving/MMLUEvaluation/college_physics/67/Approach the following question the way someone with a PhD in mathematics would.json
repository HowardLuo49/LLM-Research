The energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom in its ground state is 79.0 eV.

    "gpt_response": "To determine the energy required to ionize helium, we need to consider the energy levels of the electrons in the helium atom. In the ground state of helium, both electrons are in the 1s orbital. \n\nThe energy required to remove both electrons from the helium atom would be the sum of the ionization energies of each electron. The first ionization energy is the energy required to remove the first electron, and the second ionization energy is the energy required to remove the second electron. Given that the total energy required to remove both electrons is 79.0 eV, we can set up the following equation:\n\n1st ionization energy + 2nd ionization energy = 79.0 eV\n\nLet's assume the first ionization energy is x eV. Therefore, the second ionization energy is 79.0 - x eV.\n\nFor helium, the first ionization energy is typically around 24.6 eV, so let's substitute this value into the equation:\n\n24.6 eV + (79.0 - 24.6) = 79.0 eV\n24.6 eV + 54.4 eV = 79.0 eV\n\nTherefore, the energy required to ionize helium (to remove one electron) is 24.6 eV, which is option A.",
