    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by first understanding the theory behind the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material when it is exposed to light. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that the energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency of the light. \n\nBased on this theory, we can eliminate options C and D as they do not accurately represent the relationship between the factors involved in the photoelectric effect.\n\nNext, we need to consider whether the work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency or wavelength of the light. The work function of a metal is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the surface of the metal. In the photoelectric effect, this energy comes from the incident light.\n\nSince the energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency of the light, we can conclude that the work function of the metal is also proportional to the frequency. This means that option A is the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, as a mathematician with a PhD, I would use my understanding of the theory behind the photoelectric effect and the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and work function to accurately answer this question.",
