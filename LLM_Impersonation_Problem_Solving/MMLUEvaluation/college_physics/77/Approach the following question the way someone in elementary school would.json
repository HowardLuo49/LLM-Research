    "gpt_response": "Hey there! So, when light of different frequencies shines on a metal surface in a photoelectric tube, we can use Einstein's theory to predict some things. The correct answer is D: the potential difference needed to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. So, the higher the frequency of the light, the higher the potential difference needed to stop those electrons. Isn't science cool?",
