    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we are talking about an atom that only has one electron and it's in the l = 2 state. The quantum number m_l tells us the orientation of the electron's angular momentum. In this case, for the l = 2 state, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. So, the correct answer is D: 5.",
