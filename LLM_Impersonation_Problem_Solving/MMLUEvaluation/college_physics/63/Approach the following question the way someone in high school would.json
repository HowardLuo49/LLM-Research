    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know the electron is in the l = 2 state. The quantum number m_l represents the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and it can range from -l to +l in integer steps. Since l = 2 in this case, the values of m_l can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. That means there are 5 allowed values for m_l. So the answer is D: 5.",
