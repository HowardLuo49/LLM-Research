A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "To find the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction. This law states that the induced electromotive force (EMF) in any closed circuit is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.\n\nThe formula for the induced EMF in a coil is given by:\n\nEMF = -N * A * (\u0394B/\u0394t)\n\nwhere:\nEMF = induced electromotive force\nN = number of turns in the coil (250 in this case)\nA = area of the coil (0.2 m^2)\n\u0394B = change in magnetic field strength (final field strength - initial field strength = 0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T)\n\u0394t = time interval (0.25 s)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nEMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05 / 0.25) = -250 * 0.2 * 0.2 = -10 V\n\nTherefore, the average induced EMF in the coil is 10 V. \n\nSo the correct answer is D: 10 V.",
