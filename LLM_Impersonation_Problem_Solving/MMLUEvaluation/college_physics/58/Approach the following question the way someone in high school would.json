If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "Hey guys, let's break this question down. We have a circular coil with an area of 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil and is increasing from 0.01 T to 0.06 T in 0.25 seconds.\n\nTo find the average induced EMF in the coil, we can use the formula:\n\nEMF = -N * A * (change in B / change in t)\n\nwhere N is the number of turns (250), A is the area (0.2 m^2), change in B is the change in magnetic field (0.06 T - 0.01 T = 0.05 T), and change in t is the change in time (0.25 s).\n\nPlug in the values: EMF = -250 * 0.2 * (0.05 / 0.25) = -250 * 0.2 * 0.2 = -10 V\n\nSince we're looking for the average induced EMF, remember that the negative sign just indicates the direction of the induced current. So the answer is D: 10 V. Great job, we solved it!",
