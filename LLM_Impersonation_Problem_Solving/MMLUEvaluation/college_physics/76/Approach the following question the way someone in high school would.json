At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "To find the magnitude of the applied force, we can use the work-energy principle. The work done on an object is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the object. \n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is given by KE1 = 0.5*m*v1^2 = 0.5*10*(1)^2 = 5 J\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is given by KE2 = 0.5*10*(2)^2 = 20 J\n\nThe work done on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\nW = KE2 - KE1 = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nSince work done is equal to force times distance, we can find the magnitude of the applied force:\nW = F*d\n15 J = F*5 m\nF = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which is option C.",
