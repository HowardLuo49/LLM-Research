At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\nA: 1 N\nB: 2 N\nC: 3 N\nD: 4 N",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can apply the principles of classical mechanics. We can use the work-energy principle, which states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. \n\nInitially, the box has a kinetic energy of 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 10 * 1^2 = 5 J. \nAs the box travels 5 m with the constant force applied, the work done on the box is equal to the force applied times the distance traveled, which is F * d = W = 5 J. \nAfter the force is removed, the box has a kinetic energy of 0.5 * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 10 * 2^2 = 20 J.\n\nUsing the work-energy principle, the total work done on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy:\nW_applied + W_removed = change in kinetic energy\nF * d = 20 J - 5 J\nF * 5 = 15 J\nF = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C.",
