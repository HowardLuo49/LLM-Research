Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm...well, sound waves come out of the speaker and spread out, right? So if we want to find out when the sound disappears at an angle, we need to know how wide the opening is and how fast the sound is traveling. Let's see...the opening is 0.14 meters wide and the sound travels at 350 meters per second. \n\nBut wait, what does frequency have to do with it? Oh, I remember! Frequency is how fast the sound waves vibrate. So maybe if the waves vibrate really fast, they can diffract around the corner better. Let's pick the answer with the highest frequency, which is D: 3,500 Hz!",
