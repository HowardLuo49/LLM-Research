Sound waves moving at 350 m/s diffract out of a speaker enclosure with an opening that is a long rectangular slit 0.14 m across. At about what frequency will the sound first disappear at an angle of 45q from the normal to the speaker face?\nA: 500 Hz\nB: 1,750 Hz\nC: 2,750 Hz\nD: 3,500 Hz",

    "gpt_response": "To determine at what frequency the sound will first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face, we need to consider the size of the slit relative to the wavelength of the sound wave. \n\nThe angle of diffraction can be calculated using the formula:\n\nsin\u03b8 = \u03bb / w\n\nwhere \u03b8 = 45 degrees, \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave, and w is the width of the slit (0.14 m).\n\nFor the first disappearance to occur, the sound wave must diffract over the entire width of the slit. Therefore, the wavelength of the sound wave should be equal to the width of the slit ( \u03bb = w).\n\nSubstitute \u03bb = 0.14 m and \u03b8 = 45 degrees into the formula:\n\nsin(45 degrees) = 0.14 / \u03bb\n\n1/\u221a2 = 0.14 / \u03bb\n\n\u03bb = 0.14 / (1/\u221a2) = 0.14 * \u221a2\n\n\u03bb \u2248 0.198 m \n\nThe frequency of the sound wave can be calculated using the formula:\n\nv = f\u03bb\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound (350 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and f is the frequency.\n\nSubstitute \u03bb \u2248 0.198 m into the formula:\n\n350 = f * 0.198\n\nf \u2248 1767 Hz\n\nTherefore, the sound will first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face at a frequency of approximately 1767 Hz.
