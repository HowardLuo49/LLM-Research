Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, pretty colors! Blue light bounces off the oil film on the glass slide. Let's see, the oil has a refractive index of 1.2 and the glass has a refractive index of 1.6. So, the minimum thickness of the oil film must be... Hmm, I think it's 200 nm! So, the answer is B: 200 nm. Yay!",
