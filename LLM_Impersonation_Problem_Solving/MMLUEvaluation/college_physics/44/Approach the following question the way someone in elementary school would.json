Blue light of wavelength 480 nanometers is most strongly reflected off a thin film of oil on a glass slide when viewed near normal incidence. Assuming that the index of refraction of the oil is 1.2 and that of the glass is 1.6, what is the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) ?\nA: 150 nm\nB: 200 nm\nC: 300 nm\nD: 400 nm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. So we have blue light with a wavelength of 480 nanometers. The oil has an index of refraction of 1.2 and the glass has an index of refraction of 1.6... I think we can use the formula for minimum film thickness for constructive interference, which is:\n\nt = (m * \u03bb) / (2 * n)\n\nWhere:\nt = thickness of the film\nm = order of the interference (we want the minimum, so m = 1)\n\u03bb = wavelength of the light (480 nm)\nn = index of refraction of the oil (1.2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (1 * 480) / (2 * 1.2)\nt = 400 / 2\nt = 200 nm\n\nSo the minimum thickness of the oil film is 200 nm. And that's answer choice B!",
