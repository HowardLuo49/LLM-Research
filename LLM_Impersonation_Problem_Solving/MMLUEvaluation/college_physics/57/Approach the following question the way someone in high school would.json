If the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area does which of the following?\nA: Decreases by a factor of 81.\nB: Decreases by a factor of 9.\nC: Increases by a factor of 9.\nD: Increases by a factor of 81.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "So, if the absolute temperature of a blackbody is increased by a factor of 3, that means the temperature is tripled. Since the energy radiated by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law), when the temperature is tripled (3^4 = 81), the energy radiated per second per unit area would increase by a factor of 81. So the correct answer is option D: Increases by a factor of 81.",
