Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?\nA: 0.25 mm\nB: 0.5 mm\nC: 1.0 mm\nD: 2.0 mm",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's imagine we have a laser shining on two tiny slits. When the light goes through these slits, it creates bright lines on a screen far away. If the slits are really close together, the lines on the screen will be far apart. But if the slits are further apart, the lines on the screen will be closer together.\n\nNow, if we double the frequency of the laser light, that means the light waves will be closer together. This will make the bright lines on the screen closer together too. So the separation of the bright fringes will be smaller.\n\nSince the original separation was 1.0 mm, if we make it smaller because of the doubled frequency, the new separation will be 0.5 mm. So the answer is B: 0.5 mm.",
