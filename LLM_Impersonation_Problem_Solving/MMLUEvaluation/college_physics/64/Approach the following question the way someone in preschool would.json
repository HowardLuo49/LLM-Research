Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",

    "gpt_response": "Ooh, fun question! So, we have two pendulums, A and B, with different periods. Pendulum B's period is twice as long as pendulum A's period. That means pendulum B swings back and forth more slowly than pendulum A. If you think about it, what do you think that means about the lengths of the strings they are hanging from? Let's see...\n\nHmm, if pendulum B is swinging more slowly, maybe its string is longer so it has to travel farther to complete one swing. And if pendulum A is swinging faster, maybe its string is shorter because it doesn't have to travel as far to complete one swing. \n\nSo, since pendulum B is swinging slowly with a longer period, that means its string is longer too. And since pendulum A is swinging faster with a shorter period, that means its string is shorter. \n\nSo, what do we think? Which of these is true?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A\n\nI think it's option B! Pendulum B's length is twice the length of pendulum A. So, L_B = 2L_A! Yay! Learning about pendulums is so much fun!",
