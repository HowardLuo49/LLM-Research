Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "So, we know that the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A. This means that the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), can be written as 2T_A = T_B.\n\nSubstitute the formula for period into the equation: 2(2\u03c0\u221a(L_A / g)) = (2\u03c0\u221a(L_B / g))\n\nSimplify the equation: 4\u03c0\u221a(L_A / g) = 2\u03c0\u221a(L_B / g)\n\nSolve for L_B: \u221a(L_B / g) = 2\u221a(L_A / g)\n\nSquare both sides to isolate L_B: (L_B / g) = 4 (L_A / g)\n\nNow, divide both sides by g to find the relationship between L_B and L_A: L_B = 4L_A\n\nSo, the correct answer is: A. L_B = 4L_A",
