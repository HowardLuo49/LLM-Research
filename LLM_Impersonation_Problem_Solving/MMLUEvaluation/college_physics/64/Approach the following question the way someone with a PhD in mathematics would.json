Two simple pendulums A and B consist of identical masses suspended from strings of length L_A and L_B, respectively. The two pendulums oscillate in equal gravitational fields. If the period of pendulum B is twice the period of pendulum A, which of the following is true of the lengths of the two pendulums?\nA: L_B = 4L_A\nB: L_B = 2L_A\nC: L_B = L_A\nD: L_B = 1/2 L_A",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, we can start by using the equation for the period of a simple pendulum, which is given by T = 2\u03c0\u221a(L/g), where T is the period, L is the length of the pendulum, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Given that the periods of pendulums A and B are T_A and T_B, respectively, we can write the following equation:\n\nT_B = 2T_A\n\nSubstituting the equation for the period of a simple pendulum into the above equation, we get:\n\n2\u03c0\u221a(L_B/g) = 2 * 2\u03c0\u221a(L_A/g)\n\nSolving for L_B, we find:\n\n\u221a(L_B) = 2\u221a(L_A)\nL_B = (2\u221a(L_A))^2\nL_B = 4L_A\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: L_B = 4L_A",
