Which of the following statements about bosons and/or fermions is true?\nA: Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\nB: Bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\nC: Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\nD: Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The correct statement is D: Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This is because fermions are particles that follow the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Additionally, fermions have antisymmetric wave functions, meaning that the wave function changes sign when the positions of two particles are exchanged.",
