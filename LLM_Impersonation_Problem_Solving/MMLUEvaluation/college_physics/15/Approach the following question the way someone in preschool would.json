Fermions like to be independent and have antisymmetric wave functions. Do you know what the Pauli exclusion principle is? It's like when you play with your toys and don't like to have the same one as your friend. Fermions follow this rule, but bosons don't. So, the true statement is: C - Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.",
