But wait, I remember that bosons don't follow the Pauli exclusion principle, so this statement can't be true.\n\nB: This one says that bosons have antisymmetric wave functions and do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh no, this can't be right either because bosons actually have symmetric wave functions.\n\nC: Okay, this one says that fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Hey, that sounds right! Fermions do follow the Pauli exclusion principle, so this statement must be true.\n\nD: This last one says that fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.
