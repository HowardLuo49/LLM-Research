Now we need to find the magnitude of the particle's relativistic momentum.\n\nWe know the relation between energy, momentum, and mass is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. Since the total energy is equal to twice the rest energy, we can substitute in E = 2mc^2 to get (2mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2.\n\nSolving for p, we get p = (3^(1/2))mc.
