    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the quantum efficiency of the photon detector is 0.1, which means it can detect 10% of the photons that are sent into it. If 100 photons are sent into the detector, then on average it will detect 10 photons (100 x 0.1 = 10). \n\nNow, the rms deviation tells us how spread out the detections might be. Since the quantum efficiency is 0.1 and we are sending 100 photons, the rms deviation will be about 1 (100 x 0.1 = 10, so 10 detections on average, with a spread of about 1). \n\nSo the answer is: C) an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1.",
