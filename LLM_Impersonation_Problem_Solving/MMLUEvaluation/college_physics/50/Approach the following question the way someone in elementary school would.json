    "gpt_response": "Well, to answer this question, we need to figure out the difference between the two wavelengths that can be resolved. The difference is 2 nm (502 nm - 500 nm). \n\nSo, the resolving power of the spectrometer is the smallest change in wavelength that it can detect. It can just barely resolve a 2 nm difference. \n\nSo, the answer is A: 2.",
