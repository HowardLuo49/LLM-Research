A grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, respectively. Which of the following gives the resolving power of the spectrometer?\nA: 2\nB: 250\nC: 5,000\nD: 10,000",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the resolving power of the spectrometer, we need to calculate the smallest wavelength difference that the spectrometer can resolve. This is typically denoted by the formula \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb, where \u0394\u03bb is the minimum wavelength difference that can be resolved and \u03bb is the average of the two wavelengths being resolved.\n\nUsing the given wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, the average wavelength is (500 + 502) / 2 = 501 nm. The smallest wavelength difference that can be resolved is 502 nm - 500 nm = 2 nm.\n\nTherefore, the resolving power of the spectrometer is \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 2 nm / 501 nm \u2248 0.00399 or approximately 1/250.\n\nGiven the options:\nA: 2\nB: 250\nC: 5,000\nD: 10,000\n\nThe correct answer is B: 250.",
