At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we need to consider the fundamental frequency of a pipe that is open at both ends. The formula for the fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends is:\n\nf = v / (2L)\n\nWhere:\n- f is the frequency of resonance\n- v is the speed of sound\n- L is the length of the pipe\n\nGiven the initial conditions at 20\u00b0C, we have a frequency of 440 Hz. To solve for the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C, we can use the formula:\n\nv = 331.5 + 0.6 * t\n\nWhere:\n- t is the temperature in degrees Celsius\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is:\n\nv = 331.5 + 0.6 * 20\nv = 343.5 m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency at a temperature where the speed of sound is 3% lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. This means the speed of sound at the lower temperature is:\n\nv' = 343.5 - 0.03 * 343.5\nv' = 333.465 m/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the new frequency at the lower temperature using the same formula for the fundamental frequency of a pipe open at both ends:\n\nf' = v' / (2L)\n\nSince the length of the pipe remains constant, the frequency at the lower temperature is:\n\nf' = 333.465 / (2L)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not provided in the answer choices.",
