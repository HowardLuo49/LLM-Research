But today, because it's so cold, the sound moves slower. Hmm, let me think... Oh! I remember my teacher saying that sound moves slower when it's cold. So if it's 3 percent slower, that means the frequency will be a little lower too. Let's see, 3 percent of 440 is... umm, I'm not sure. But I think if we take away a little bit from 440, we'll get the answer! So let's try... 440 minus a little bit... Oh, I think it's 427 hertz! So the answer is B: 427 Hz! Yay, we figured it out!",
