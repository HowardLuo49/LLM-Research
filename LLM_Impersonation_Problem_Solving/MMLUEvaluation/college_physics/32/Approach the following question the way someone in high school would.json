At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hey, so we have a pipe that resonates at 440 hertz at 20\u00b0C. Now, on a cold day, the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. We need to find out the new frequency at which the pipe resonates on this cold day.\n\nSo, let's calculate the new speed of sound first. The speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is approximately 343 m/s. At 3 percent lower, it would be 343 * 0.97 = 332.71 m/s.\n\nNow, the formula for the resonant frequency of a pipe open at both ends is f = v/2L, where f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nSince the pipe length remains constant, the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound. Therefore, the new frequency would be f = 332.71/343 * 440 = 427 Hz.\n\nSo, the answer is B: 427 Hz.",
