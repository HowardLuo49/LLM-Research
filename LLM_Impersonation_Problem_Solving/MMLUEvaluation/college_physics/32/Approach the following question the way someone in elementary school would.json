At what frequency does the same pipe resonate on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C ?\nA: 414 Hz\nB: 427 Hz\nC: 433 Hz\nD: 440 Hz",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the pipe resonates at 440 hertz when it's 20\u00b0C. But on a cold day when the speed of sound is lower, we need to figure out the new frequency. Since the speed of sound is 3 percent lower, we can multiply 440 by 97% (100% - 3%=97%) to find the new frequency. \n\n440 x 0.97 = 426.8\n\nSo, the frequency the pipe resonates at on a cold day is about 427 hertz. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 427 Hz.",
