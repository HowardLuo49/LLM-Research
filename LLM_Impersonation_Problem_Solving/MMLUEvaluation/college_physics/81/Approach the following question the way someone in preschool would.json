Right now, we are in the n = 4, l = 1 state, which means we are hiding in a specific place. Now, our teacher tells us we have to move to a different hiding spot through an allowed transition. We look at the options:\n\nA: n = 3, l = 2 - This hiding spot is lower than where we are currently hiding, so we can move here.\nB: n = 3, l = 1 - This spot is okay for us to move to because the energy level is lower.\nC: n = 3, l = 0 - Oh no, this hiding spot is not allowed for us to move to because the energy level is lower and the orbitals don't match!\nD: n = 2, l = 0 - This spot is okay to move to because it's lower than where we are hiding.\n\nSo the answer is C: n = 3, l = 0.
