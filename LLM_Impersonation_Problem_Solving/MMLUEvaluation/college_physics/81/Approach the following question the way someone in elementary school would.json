    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So first of all, the electron is in the n = 4, l = 1 state. That means the electron is in the fourth energy level and has l = 1 angular momentum quantum number.\n\nNow, we have to look at each of the final states one by one to see if they could be reached by an allowed transition from the initial state.\n\n- A: n = 3, l = 2. Since n is decreasing and l is decreasing, this transition is allowed because it follows the rules for transitions.\n\n- B: n = 3, l = 1. Since n is decreasing but l is staying the same, this transition is allowed because it follows the rules for transitions.\n\n- C: n = 3, l = 0. Since n is decreasing and l is decreasing, this transition is allowed because it follows the rules for transitions.\n\n- D: n = 2, l = 0. This final state cannot be reached by an allowed transition. Going from n = 4 to n = 2 would involve a negative \u2206l, which is not allowed according to the selection rules for transitions.\n\nSo, the answer is D: n = 2, l = 0.",
