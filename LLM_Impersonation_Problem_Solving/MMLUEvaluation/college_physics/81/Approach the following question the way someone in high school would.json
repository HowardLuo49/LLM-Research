Looking at the options, I remember that the electron can only transition to a state with a lower energy level, and also the change in angular momentum has to be \u00b11. \n\nSo, since the electron is in the n = 4, l = 1 state, it can only transition to the n = 3 states because that's lower in energy. Also, since l can only change by \u00b11, it can't transition to n = 2, l = 0.\n\nSo, the final state that can NOT be reached by an allowed transition is D: n = 2, l = 0.",
