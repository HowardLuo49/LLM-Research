    "gpt_response": "First, we recall the definition of angular momentum in the context of circular orbits. Angular momentum (L) of an object in circular motion is given by the product of its moment of inertia (I) and its angular velocity (\u03c9).\n\nFor a satellite in circular orbit, its moment of inertia is proportional to its mass and orbital radius squared, while its angular velocity is related to the orbital radius and the gravitational force.\n\nGiven that the satellites A and B are identical in mass, the angular momentum of each satellite is directly proportional to the product of its orbital radius and its angular velocity.\n\nLet the orbital radius of satellite A be denoted by Ra and that of satellite B be denoted by Rb. It is given that Ra = 2Rb.\n\nThus, the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is:\nL_A/L_B = (Ra * \u03c9_A)/(Rb * \u03c9_B) = (2Rb * \u03c9_A)/(Rb * \u03c9_B) = 2(\u03c9_A/\u03c9_B) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2.",
