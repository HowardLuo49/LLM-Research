    "gpt_response": "So there are these two satellites, A and B, right? They're going around Earth in circles! Satellite A is further away than satellite B, but they're the same size. Now, we need to figure out the ratio of the spinning energy of A to B. Is it 4? 2? Or maybe the square root of 2? Or 1 divided by the square root of 2? Hmm...let's see... Oh, I think it's 4! Because A is twice as far away as B, so it has 4 times the spinning energy! Yay!",
