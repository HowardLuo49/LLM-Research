    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem using mathematical rigor, we can start by expressing the work done in stretching each spring as a function of the force constant and the distance stretched. Let x represent the distance stretched for the first spring.\n\nFor the first spring:\nWork = 0.5kx^2\n\nFor the second spring:\nSince it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the distance of the first spring, the distance stretched for the second spring would be x/2.\nSo, work = 0.5k(0.5x)^2 = 0.5k(0.25x^2) = 0.125kx^2\n\nNow, we can set up the equation based on the problem statement:\n0.125kx^2 = 2(0.5kx^2)\n\nSolving for the force constant of the second spring:\n0.125kx^2 = kx^2\n0.125k = k\nk = 8k\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 8k.
