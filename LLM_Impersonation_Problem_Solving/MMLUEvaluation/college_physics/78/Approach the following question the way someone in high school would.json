It takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. The force constant of the second spring is\nA: k\nB: 2k\nC: 4k\nD: 8k",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. The work done in stretching a spring is given by the formula W = 1/2 * k * x^2, where k is the force constant and x is the distance stretched.\n\nSo for the first spring, we have W1 = 1/2 * k * x1^2.\n\nFor the second spring, we are told that it takes twice as much work to stretch it by half the distance. So the work done on the second spring is W2 = 2 * W1 = 2 * (1/2 * k * (x1/2)^2) = 1/2 * k * (x1/2)^2.\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression. (x1/2)^2 = x1^2 / 4.\n\nTherefore, W2 = 1/2 * k * (x1/2)^2 = 1/2 * k * (x1^2 / 4) = 1/8 * k * x1^2.\n\nSo for the second spring, the work done is given by W2 = 1/8 * k * x1^2.\n\nSince we know that W2 = 1/8 * k * x1^2, we can see that the force constant of the second spring is 8 times the force constant of the first spring. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 8k.",
