How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to find out what the particle is doing. It's starting at rest and then needs to be accelerated to 0.6 times the speed of light. That's pretty fast!\n\nIn order to figure out how much work needs to be done, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2. Since the particle starts at rest, its initial velocity is 0, so the formula simplifies to KE = (1/2)mv^2.\n\nPlugging in the values we know (m and v), we get KE = (1/2)m(0.6c)^2 = (1/2)m(0.36c^2) = 0.18mc^2.\n\nSo the correct answer is not listed, but it would be 0.18mc^2.",
