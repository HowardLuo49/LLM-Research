How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the work done on a particle to accelerate it to a speed of 0.6c, we can use the work-energy principle. \n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle at a speed of 0.6c can be calculated as:\n\nKE = (\u03b3 - 1) * mc^2\n\nwhere \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nGiven that v = 0.6c and the particle starts at rest, the initial speed is 0 and \u03b3 = 1. So the kinetic energy at 0.6c is:\n\nKE = (1/sqrt(1 - 0.6^2)) * m * c^2 - m * c^2\n   = (1/sqrt(0.64)) * m * c^2 - m * c^2\n   = (1/0.8) * m * c^2 - m * c^2\n   = 1.25 m * c^2 - m * c^2\n   = 0.25 m * c^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 0.25mc^2",
