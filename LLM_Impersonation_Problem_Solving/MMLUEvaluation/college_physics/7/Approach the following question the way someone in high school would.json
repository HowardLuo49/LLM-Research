How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. So we know that the particle starts at rest and reaches a speed of 0.6c. In order to find the work done, we can use the formula for kinetic energy: KE = (gamma - 1) * mc^2, where gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).\n\nSince the particle starts at rest, the initial velocity would be 0 and gamma would be equal to 1. When the particle reaches a speed of 0.6c, gamma would be equal to 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1.25.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get KE = (1.25 - 1) * mc^2 = 0.25mc^2.\n\nSo the correct answer is A: 0.25mc^2.",
