Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of length contraction from special relativity. According to special relativity, the length of an object moving at a relativistic speed appears shorter in the direction of motion when measured by an observer in a different inertial frame.\n\nLet L be the proper length of the meterstick (60 cm) as measured by an observer at rest with respect to it, and L' be the measured length of the meterstick when it is moving at relativistic speed v. According to length contraction, L' = L * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)), where c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, we have L' = 60 cm and L = 60 cm. Therefore, the equation becomes 60 = 60 * sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).\n\nSolving for v, we get v = c * sqrt(1 - (L'/L)^2). Substituting the given values, we get v = c * sqrt(1 - (0.60)^2) = c * sqrt(1 - 0.36) = c * sqrt(0.64) = 0.8c.\n\nSince the speed of the spaceships was given as equal, but in opposite directions, the total speed of the two spaceships relative to Earth would be twice that, which gives us 2 * 0.8c = 1.6c.\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, would be 0.8c. However, since the options provided are in terms of a fraction of the speed of light c, the closest option would be B: 0.5c.",
