Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. A meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. What is the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth?\nA: 0.4c\nB: 0.5c\nC: 0.6c\nD: 0.7c",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Well, if two spaceships are coming towards Earth at the same speed but from opposite directions, that means they are going at half the speed of light each. So, the answer is B: 0.5c.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to B?: Well, if two spaceships are coming towards Earth at the same speed but from opposite directions, that means they are going at half the speed of light each. So, the answer is B: 0.5c.",
