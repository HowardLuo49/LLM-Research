A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Gee, I don't know the answer, but I remember hearing that when light enters water, it slows down! So maybe the speed of light in the water is slower than in the lab frame, which is 1/2 c. Hmmm...I think that would make the answer B: 2/3 c.",
