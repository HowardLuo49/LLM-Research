A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so imagine the tube of water is like a moving train and the beam of light is a passenger getting on the train. If the train is already moving at half its top speed, then the passenger will still see the train moving at that speed. That means the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is still 1/2 c. So, the answer is A: 1/2 c.",
