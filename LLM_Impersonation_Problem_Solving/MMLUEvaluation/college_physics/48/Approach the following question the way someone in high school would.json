A tube of water is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame when a beam of light traveling in the same direction as the tube enters it. What is the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame? (The index of refraction of water is 4/3.)\nA: 1/2 c\nB: 2/3 c\nC: 5/6 c\nD: 10/11 c",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know the tube is moving at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame and the beam of light is also moving in the same direction as the tube. \nWe also know that the index of refraction of water is 4/3. \nTo find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, we can use the formula n=c/v, where n is the index of refraction, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and v is the speed of light in the medium. \nSo, we can solve for v in the medium by rearranging the formula to get v=c/n. \nIn this case, c in a vacuum is c and n is 4/3. \nTherefore, v=c/(4/3)=(3/4)c=(3c)/4. \nSince the tube is traveling at 1/2 c, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is (3c)/4-1/2 c=(3c-2c)/4=(c)/4=(1/4)c. \nTherefore, the answer is A: 1/2 c.",
