It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\nA: 6.0 e\nB: 6.8 eV\nC: 12.2 eV\nD: 13.6 eV",

Just like how hydrogen atoms have protons, positronium atoms have positrons!\n\nNow, let's think about when a positronium atom goes from a state with n=3 to a state with n=1. That's like when we jump from the bottom to the top of a bunk bed! Exciting, right?\n\nThe energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to 6.8 eV, which is like saying the top bunk bed is 6.8 feet high! So, I think the answer is B: 6.8 eV! Yay for positronium atoms and energy!",
