It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\nA: 6.0 e\nB: 6.8 eV\nC: 12.2 eV\nD: 13.6 eV",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about positronium like a little hydrogen atom but with a positron instead of a proton. When a positronium atom goes from n=3 to n=1, it releases energy in the form of a photon. We need to figure out how much energy that photon has. \n\nThe energy of a photon emitted during a transition in an atom is given by the formula E = 13.6 eV * (1/n^2 - 1/n^2). So for our transition from n=3 to n=1, we plug in those numbers:\nE = 13.6 eV * (1/1^2 - 1/3^2)\nE = 13.6 eV * (1 - 1/9)\nE = 13.6 eV * (8/9)\nE \u2248 12.2 eV\n\nSo, the energy of the photon emitted during this transition is closest to C: 12.2 eV. Great job figuring that out!",
