It is similar to the hydrogen atom, with the positron replacing the proton. If a positronium atom makes a transition from the state with n=3 to a state with n=1, the energy of the photon emitted in this transition is closest to\nA: 6.0 e\nB: 6.8 eV\nC: 12.2 eV\nD: 13.6 eV",

    "gpt_response": "Hey guys! So, we know that positronium is like hydrogen but with a positron instead of a proton. And we also know that when an atom transitions from a higher energy level (like n=3) to a lower energy level (like n=1), it emits a photon.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the energy of that photon. The energy of a photon can be calculated using the equation E = 13.6 eV (Z^2/n^2), where Z is the atomic number (which is 1 for positronium) and n is the principal quantum number.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, we get E = 13.6 eV (1^2/1^2) = 13.6 eV.\n\nSince the question asks for the energy closest to the emitted photon, the closest answer choice is D: 13.6 eV.\n\nHope that helps!",
