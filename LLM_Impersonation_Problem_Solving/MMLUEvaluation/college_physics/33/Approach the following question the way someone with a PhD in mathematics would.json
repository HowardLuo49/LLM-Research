    "gpt_response": "As a person with a PhD in mathematics would approach this question, we must first understand the concept of quantum efficiency. Quantum efficiency refers to the efficiency with which a detector is able to convert incoming photons into detected signals. In this case, the quantum efficiency of the photon detector is given as 0.1, meaning that the detector will detect 10% of the photons that are sent into it.\n\nGiven that 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, the expected number of photons detected by the detector can be calculated as the product of the number of photons sent and the quantum efficiency. Therefore, the expected number of photons detected is 100 * 0.1 = 10.\n\nIn statistical terms, the number of photons detected by the detector can be modeled as a binomial distribution, with parameters n = 100 (number of trials) and p = 0.1 (probability of success). The mean of this distribution is n * p = 100 * 0.1 = 10. The root mean square (rms) deviation of a binomial distribution can be approximated by sqrt(n * p * (1-p)), so the rms deviation in this case would be sqrt(100 * 0.1 * 0.9) = sqrt(9) = 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.",
