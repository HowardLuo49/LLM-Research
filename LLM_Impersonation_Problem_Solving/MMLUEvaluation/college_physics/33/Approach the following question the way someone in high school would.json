    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the quantum efficiency of the photon detector is 0.1, which means that for every 10 photons sent into the detector, it will only detect 1 photon on average. So if we send in 100 photons one after the other, the detector will likely detect around 10 photons. The answer is A: exactly 10 times.",
