    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. If the atom has n = 1 and n = 2 levels filled, that means it has 2 levels. Since each level can only hold a certain number of electrons, we need to add up how many electrons can fit in each level. Let's count together! 1 level has 2 electrons, and 2 levels have... 4 electrons! So the answer is... B: 4 electrons! Yay, we did it!",
