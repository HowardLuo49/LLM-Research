    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the centripetal force required to keep the coin from sliding outward on the turntable. \n\nThe centripetal force required is provided by the static friction force acting on the coin. The formula for centripetal force is Fc = mv^2/r, where Fc is the centripetal force, m is the mass of the coin, v is the tangential speed of the coin (which can be calculated from the rotational speed of the turntable), and r is the distance from the center of the turntable.\n\nThe maximum static friction force that can be provided is given by \u03bcsN, where \u03bcs is the coefficient of static friction (0.30 in this case) and N is the normal force acting on the coin.\n\nAt the maximum distance from the center of the turntable, the static friction force must be equal to the centripetal force to prevent the coin from sliding. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\u03bcsN = mv^2/r\n\nThe normal force N is equal to the weight of the coin, which is mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nr = mv^2 / (\u03bcsg)\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\nr = mv^2 / (\u03bcsg) = (m(2\u03c0rPS)^2)/(\u03bcsg), where PS is the rotational speed in radians per second.\n\nGiven PS = (33.3 rev/min)(2\u03c0 rad/rev)/(60 s/min) = 3.49 rad/s\n\nSubstitute the values of m = mass of the coin, g = 9.81 m/s^2, \u03bcs = 0.30, PS = 3.49 into the equation, we have:\n\nr = (m(2\u03c0(3.49))^2)/(0.30*9.81)\n\nSolving for r, we get r \u2248 0.024 m\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is 0.024 m, which corresponds to option A.",
