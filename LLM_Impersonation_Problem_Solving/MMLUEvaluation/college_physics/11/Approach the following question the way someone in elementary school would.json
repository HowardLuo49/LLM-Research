The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. What is the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide?\nA: 0.024 m\nB: 0.048 m\nC: 0.121 m\nD: 0.242 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Ok kiddos, so basically when the turntable is spinning, the coin might start sliding if the friction isn't strong enough. In this case, we know the coefficient of static friction is 0.30. The turntable is spinning at 33.3 revolutions per minute, but we don't really need to worry about that.\n\nJust remember that the maximum distance from the center of the turntable that the coin will not slide is 0.024 meters. So the answer is A: 0.024 m! Yay!",
