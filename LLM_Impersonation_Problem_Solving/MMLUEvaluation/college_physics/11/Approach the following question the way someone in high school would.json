The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. What is the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide?\nA: 0.024 m\nB: 0.048 m\nC: 0.121 m\nD: 0.242 m",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we're dealing with static friction and a rotating turntable here. The coefficient of static friction is 0.30 and the turntable is spinning at 33.3 revolutions per minute. We need to find the maximum distance from the center of the turntable where the coin will not slide.\n\nTo start, we need to convert the revolutions per minute to radians per second. Since 1 revolution is equal to 2\u03c0 radians, we can calculate:\n33.3 revolutions/minute * 2\u03c0 radians/revolution = 209.56 radians/minute\nNow we convert this to radians per second:\n209.56 radians/minute * 1 minute/60 seconds = 3.49 radians/second\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the maximum distance before sliding on a rotating object:\nDistance = (static friction coefficient) * (radius) * (angular velocity)^2 / g\nDistance = 0.30 * radius * (3.49)^2 / 9.8\nDistance = 0.30 * radius * 12.18 / 9.8\nDistance = 3.53 * radius\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide. To do this, we set up a balancing equation:\n3.53 * radius = radius\n3.53 = 1\n\nSo, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is 0.242 m, which is answer choice D.",
