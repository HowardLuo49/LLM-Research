How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?\nA: 0.25mc^2\nB: 0.60mc^2\nC: 0.67mc^2\nD: 1.25mc^2",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "OMG, so like totally we have protons in cancer therapy that need to be accelerated to 0.6c, right? And they start at rest. So like, how much work needs to be done on them to get them to that speed? Can you imagine?\n\nOkay, so like the equation for work done is W = Kf - Ki, where W is work done, Kf is final kinetic energy, and Ki is initial kinetic energy. Since the protons start at rest, their initial kinetic energy is zero, so W = Kf.\n\nAnd the kinetic energy equation is K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo, we can plug in the values and calculate the work done on the particle:\n\n\u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25\n\nKf = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2\n\nSo, like the work done on the particle to accelerate it to 0.6c is 0.25mc^2. So, the answer is like totally A: 0.25mc^2. Yay, we got this! \ud83c\udf89",
