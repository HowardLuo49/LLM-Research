So, I have to find the speed of light inside this material with a dielectric constant of 4.0. \n\nI remember that the speed of light in a vacuum is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. If the dielectric constant is 4.0, then I should divide the speed of light by 4.0 to find the speed inside the material. \n\nHmm, now I just need to do the math... 3.0 x 10^8 divided by 4 is... 7.5 x 10^7... so, the speed of light inside the material is 1.5 x 10^8 m/s.
