If the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is increased by a factor of\nA: 2\nB: 4\nC: 8\nD: 16",

    "gpt_response": "So, we know that the energy from electromagnetic waves in equilibrium in a cavity is used to melt ice. If the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, then we need to figure out how this affects the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time.\n\nI think the answer is B: 4. Since temperature is directly proportional to the energy in the cavity, if we double the Kelvin temperature, we quadruple the energy. And since the energy is used to melt ice, if we quadruple the energy, we can melt four times the amount of ice in the same amount of time.\n\nSo, yup, I'm pretty sure the answer is B: 4.",
