The first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Which of the harmonics, if any, will survive once the pipe is closed at one end?\nA: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only\nB: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only\nC: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only\nD: None",

    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, I would approach this question by analyzing the properties of harmonics in pipes. When a pipe is open at both ends, harmonics are produced at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. In this case, the first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\nWhen a pipe is closed at one end, the harmonics are no longer at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Instead, only odd harmonics can survive when a pipe is closed at one end. Therefore, the only harmonics that will survive once the pipe is closed at one end are those with odd multiples of the original fundamental frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only.",
