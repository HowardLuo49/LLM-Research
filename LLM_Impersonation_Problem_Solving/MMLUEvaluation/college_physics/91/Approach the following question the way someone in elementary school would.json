    "gpt_response": "Okay, so the question is asking how fast light travels inside a certain material. Let's see, the dielectric constant is 4.0. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a vacuum is 3.0 * 10^8 m/s. To find the speed of light in the material, we need to divide the speed of light in a vacuum by the square root of the dielectric constant. So, let's do the math... \n\n3.0 * 10^8 m/s divided by the square root of 4 is... 1.5 * 10^8 m/s! So, the answer is C: 1.5 * 10^8 m/s.",
