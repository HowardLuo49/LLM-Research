    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the speed of light in a vacuum is 3.0 * 10^8 m/s. Since the dielectric constant is 4.0, the speed of light inside the material will be slower. To find the speed of light in the material, we need to divide the speed of light in a vacuum by the square root of the dielectric constant. So, let's do the math: \n\n3.0 * 10^8 m/s / sqrt(4.0) = 3.0 * 10^8 m/s / 2.0 = 1.5 * 10^8 m/s \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1.5 * 10^8 m/s.",
