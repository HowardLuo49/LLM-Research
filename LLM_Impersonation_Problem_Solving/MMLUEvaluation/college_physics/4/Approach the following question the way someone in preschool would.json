Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",

    "gpt_response": "Wow, let's think about this in a fun way! So, helium atoms can be in different excited states, like para- and ortho-. These states depend on how the electrons are spinning. When the electrons are spinning in opposite directions, that's para-. When they are spinning in the same direction, that's ortho-.\n\nNow, why does the ortho- state have lower energy than the para- state? Hmmm... let's see. Oh, I know! It's because of the Pauli exclusion principle! This principle says that no two electrons can have the same spin in the same state. So, in the ortho- state, the electrons are spinning in the same direction, which is allowed by the Pauli exclusion principle and makes the energy lower.\n\nYay, we figured it out!
