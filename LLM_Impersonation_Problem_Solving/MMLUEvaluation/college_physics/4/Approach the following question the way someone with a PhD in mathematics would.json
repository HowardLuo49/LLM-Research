Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "In order to understand the observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state in the helium atom, one must consider the Pauli exclusion principle. \n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This means that in the case of the helium atom, where two electrons occupy the same energy level, they must have opposite spins to avoid violating the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nIn the para- state of the helium atom, the two electrons have antiparallel spins, while in the ortho- state, the two electrons have parallel spins. Because of the nature of the electron-electron interaction, the ortho- state has a lower energy than the para- state due to the stronger electron-electron repulsion in the parallel spin configuration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The Pauli exclusion principle.",
