An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's think about this organ pipe. It's closed at one end and open at the other. The fundamental frequency is C, which is 131 Hz. Now, the next higher harmonic is like the next note that the pipe can make. To find this, we need to remember that the fundamental frequency is the first harmonic, so the next one will be the second harmonic. \n\nTo find the frequency of the second harmonic, we just need to multiply the fundamental frequency by 2. So, 131 Hz x 2 = 262 Hz. \n\nSo, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe is C: 262 Hz.",
