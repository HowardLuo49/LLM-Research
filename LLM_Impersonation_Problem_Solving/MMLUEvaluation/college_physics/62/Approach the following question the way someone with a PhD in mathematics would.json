An organ pipe, closed at one end and open at the other, is designed to have a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). What is the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe?\nA: 44 Hz\nB: 196 Hz\nC: 262 Hz\nD: 393 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the frequency of the next higher harmonic for the closed organ pipe, we first need to know the relationship between the fundamental frequency and the higher harmonics for a closed pipe. For a pipe closed at one end, the harmonics are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nSo, the frequency of the next higher harmonic would be the third harmonic, which is three times the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe would be:\n\n3 * 131 Hz = 393 Hz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 393 Hz",
