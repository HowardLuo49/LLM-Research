The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the Doppler effect equation for light waves. The Doppler effect equation for light waves is:\n\n(\u03bb_observed - \u03bb_rest) / \u03bb_rest = v/c\n\nWhere \u03bb_observed is the observed wavelength, \u03bb_rest is the rest wavelength, v is the relative speed between the source and the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven in the problem, the observed wavelength is three times the rest wavelength (i.e., \u03bb_observed = 3\u03bb_rest). Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\n(3\u03bb_rest - \u03bb_rest) / \u03bb_rest = v/c\n2 = v/c\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar 3C9 and Earth is v = 2c.
