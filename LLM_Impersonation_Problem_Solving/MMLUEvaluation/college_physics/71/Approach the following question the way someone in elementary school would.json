The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first, we have to understand that when light waves get stretched out, they appear more red. In this case, the hydrogen lines from the quasar 3C9 are three times longer than the ones on Earth! That means the light from 3C9 is moving away from us really fast. \n\nNow, we have to figure out the relative speed of 3C9. Since the wavelengths are three times longer, that means the light is moving away at a speed of 0.8c (option C) relative to us on Earth. So, the answer is C: 0.8c.",
