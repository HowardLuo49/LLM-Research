The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",

    "gpt_response": "Wow, that's a big word - quasar! It sounds like a really far away place in space. Okay, so there are these things called hydrogen lines that are red and have different wavelengths. They are longer in quasar 3C9 than on Earth. This means that 3C9 is moving really fast compared to Earth. So, which answer choice is the speed of 3C9 relative to Earth? Let's see... Oh, I think it might be choice B: c! Yay!",
