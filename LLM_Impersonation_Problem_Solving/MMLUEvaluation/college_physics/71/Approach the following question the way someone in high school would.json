The hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. If it is assumed that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, the relative speed of the quasar is\nA: 2c\nB: c\nC: 0.8c\nD: 0.5c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are shifted to three times longer wavelengths compared to those observed in the lab on Earth. This is due to the Doppler effect, which happens when objects are moving towards or away from each other. \n\nSince the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, we can use the formula for the Doppler effect to find the relative speed of the quasar. \n\nThe formula is: \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = v/c, where \u0394\u03bb is the change in wavelength, \u03bb is the original wavelength, v is the speed of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that the observed wavelength is 3 times longer than the rest wavelength, we can plug in the values: \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb = 3, and solve for v/c.\n\nSo v/c = 3, which means the relative speed of the quasar is 3 times the speed of light (c). But since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, we know that the answer must be less than c. \n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is 0.5c, which is option D.",
