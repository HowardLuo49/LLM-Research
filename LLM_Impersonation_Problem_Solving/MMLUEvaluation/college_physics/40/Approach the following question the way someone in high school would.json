    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is:\n\nD: 4 W\n\nExplanation: When the voltage across the resistor is doubled, the power dissipated in the resistor is quadrupled. This is because power is proportional to the square of the voltage: P = V^2/R. So, if the voltage is doubled, the power will be four times the original power.",
