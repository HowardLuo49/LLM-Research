Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let me think like an elementary school student... \n\nWell, Einstein said that the frequency of the light shining on the metal affects how easy it is for electrons to be emitted. So, I guess that means the answer is D: the potential difference needed to stop the electrons is related to the frequency of the light.",
