Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect predicts that the\nA: work function of the metal is proportional to the frequency\nB: work function of the metal is proportional to the wavelength\nC: current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so when light of different frequencies shines on a metal surface in a photoelectric tube, we need to remember what Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect says. According to the theory, the potential difference needed to stop the emitted electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of the light above a certain threshold frequency. \n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\nD: potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency",
