An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",

That means O' is moving faster than O! Let's find out how fast O' is going compared to O. Hmm...I think the answer is...um...oh! I pick C: 0.36c! Yay!",
