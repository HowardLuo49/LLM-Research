An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have observer O at rest and observer O' moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis. O sees both sources of light flash simultaneously, but O' sees one source flash 13 ns before the other.\n\nWe know that the difference in time between the flashes for O' is 13 ns, and the distance between the sources is 10 m. \n\nTo find the speed of O' relative to O, we can use the time dilation formula:\n\n\u0394t' = \u0394t / \u221a(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nWhere \u0394t is the time interval for O, \u0394t' is the time interval for O', v is the speed of O' relative to O, and c is the speed of light.\n\nSince we know the difference in time is 13 ns (or 13 x 10^-9 s), we can plug in the values:\n\n13 x 10^-9 = 0 / \u221a(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nSolving for v^2 / c^2, we get v^2 / c^2 = 0.285\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get v / c = 0.533\n\nTherefore, the speed of O' relative to O is 0.53c.\n\nSo the answer is D: 0.53c.",
