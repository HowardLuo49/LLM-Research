    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, let's pretend we are in an elementary school classroom and we are learning about observers and sources of light! Imagine you are sitting at your desk, O, and there are two light sources in the room. One is at the front of the classroom (x = 0) and one is at the back of the classroom (x = 10). \n\nNow, if you see both lights flash at the same time, that's what you see. But if someone is running past the classroom (O'), they might see one light flash before the other because they are moving. It's like when you're on a train and you see things outside the window move past you quickly.\n\nSo, the question is asking how fast O' is moving compared to you, O. By looking at how much earlier one light source flashes compared to the other (13 ns), we can figure out the speed of O' relative to O.\n\nThe correct answer is C: 0.36c. This means O' is moving at 0.36 times the speed of light compared to O. Pretty cool, right? Science is really amazing!",
