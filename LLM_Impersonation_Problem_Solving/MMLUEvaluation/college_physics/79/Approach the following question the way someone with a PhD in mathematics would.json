An observer O at rest midway between two sources of light at x = 0 and x = 10 m observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. According to a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other. Which of the following gives the speed of O' relative to O?\nA: 0.13c\nB: 0.15c\nC: 0.36c\nD: 0.53c",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let's denote the distance between the two sources of light as L = 10 m. The time difference observed by O' between the two flashes is 13 ns.\n\nLet's denote the speed of O' relative to O as v. According to the theory of special relativity, time dilation occurs when an observer is moving at a constant speed relative to another observer. The time dilation formula is given by:\n\n\u0394t' = \u0394t / \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\n\u0394t' = time observed by O'\n\u0394t = time observed by O (simultaneous flashes)\nv = speed of O' relative to O\nc = speed of light\n\nSince O observes the flashes as simultaneous, the time interval for O is simply the time it takes light to travel from one source to the other, which is L/c. Therefore, \u0394t = L/c.\n\nGiven that one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other for O', we have:\n\n\u0394t' = L/c + 13 ns\n\nSubstitute these values into the time dilation formula:\n\nL/c + 13 ns = L / \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nAfter simplifying:\n\n1 + 13 ns / c = 1 / \u221a(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSolving for v, we find v = 0.15c.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 0.15c.",
