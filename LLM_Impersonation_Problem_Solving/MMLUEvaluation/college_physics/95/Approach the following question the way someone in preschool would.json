If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\nA: 4.9 m\nB: 9.8 m\nC: 10.0 m\nD: 19.6 m",

    "gpt_response": "If you throw something out the window of a building, it falls down to the ground. The thing you throw goes really fast at first, then slows down as it comes to the ground. In this case, the thing was thrown at 20 m/s, and it took 2 seconds to reach the ground. To find out how high the window was, we can use a special formula that goes like this: distance = (initial velocity x time) - (0.5 x acceleration x time^2). \n\nFirst, we know the initial velocity is 20 m/s, the time it took to hit the ground was 2.0 s, and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2. Plugging in the numbers, we get: distance = (20 x 2) - (0.5 x 9.8 x 2^2) = 40 - (0.5 x 9.8 x 4) = 40 - 19.6 = 20.4 m. \n\nSo, the object was thrown from a height of 20.4 m. Since that's not an option, the closest answer is 19.6 m (D). Yay, we solved the problem!",
