If the initial speed of the object is 20 m/s and it hits the ground 2.0 s later, from what height was it thrown? (Neglect air resistance and assume the ground is level.)\nA: 4.9 m\nB: 9.8 m\nC: 10.0 m\nD: 19.6 m",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well, let's see. The object was thrown horizontally, so that means its vertical speed is 0 m/s. The only force acting on the object is gravity, which pulls it downward. Since the object took 2.0 s to hit the ground and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, we can use the formula d = 0.5 * g * t\u00b2 to find the height from which the object was thrown. Plugging in the values gives us d = 0.5 * 9.8 * (2.0)\u00b2 = 19.6 m. So, the answer is D: 19.6 m.",
