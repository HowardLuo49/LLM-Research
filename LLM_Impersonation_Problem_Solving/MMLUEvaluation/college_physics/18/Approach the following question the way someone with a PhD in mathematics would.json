In the observer\u2019s reference frame, how long does it take the stick to pass the observer ?\nA: 1.6 ns\nB: 2.5 ns\nC: 4.2 ns\nD: 6.9 ns",

    "gpt_response": "To begin solving this problem, we must first understand the concept of relativistic length contraction. According to special relativity, objects moving at relativistic speeds will appear shorter in the direction of motion when observed from a stationary reference frame. The formula for length contraction is given by:\n\nL = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere L is the contracted length of the object, L0 is the rest length of the object, v is the speed of the object, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the rest length of the meter stick (L0) is 1 meter, the speed of the stick (v) is 0.8c, and the speed of light (c) is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. Substituting these values into the formula, we calculate the contracted length of the stick to be:\n\nL = 1 * sqrt(1 - (0.8)^2)\nL = 1 * sqrt(1 - 0.64)\nL = 1 * sqrt(0.36)\nL = 1 * 0.6\nL = 0.6 meters\n\nNow, we need to determine the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer in the observer's reference frame. Since the speed of the stick is 0.8c, and the contracted length of the stick is 0.6 meters, we can calculate the time taken for the stick to pass the observer by dividing the contracted length by the speed of the stick:\n\nTime = Length / Speed\nTime = 0.6 / 0.8c\nTime = 0.75 / c\n\nNow, we convert this time to nanoseconds:\n\nTime = 0.75 / (3 x 10^8)\nTime = 2.5 x 10^-9 seconds\nTime = 2.5 ns\n\nTherefore, it takes 2.5 ns for the meter stick to pass the observer in the observer's reference frame. Thus, the correct answer is B: 2.5 ns.",
