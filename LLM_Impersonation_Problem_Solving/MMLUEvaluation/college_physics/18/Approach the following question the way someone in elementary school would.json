    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's say the meter stick is like a really fast car zooming past you. You know how cars have different speeds? Well, the meter stick is going almost as fast as light! That's super fast.\n\nNow, when you see the stick passing by, it's going at 0.8 times the speed of light. So, it's going really, really fast. But because it's going so quick, it doesn't take a lot of time to pass by you.\n\nSo, if you think about it, the answer must be A: 1.6 ns. That's because the stick is going fast and it doesn't take long at all for it to pass by you.\n\nRemember, even though it's going fast, it's still just a meter stick. Just imagine how fast a car would have to be going to pass you in just 1.6 nanoseconds!",
