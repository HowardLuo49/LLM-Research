    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Umm, okay so we know the stick is moving at 0.8c, which is really fast. And we need to figure out how long it takes to pass by the observer. I think we need to use the time dilation formula for this. Let's see, the time dilation formula is t = t\u2080 / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Plug in the values: t\u2080 = length of the stick / speed of the stick = 1m / 0.8c = 1 / (0.8 * 3 * 10^8) = 1.25 * 10^-9 s. Now plug that into the formula: t = (1.25 * 10^-9) / \u221a(1 - (0.8)^2) = 1.25 * 10^-9 / \u221a(1 - 0.64) = 1.25 * 10^-9 / \u221a0.36 = 1.25 * 10^-9 / 0.6 = 2.08 * 10^-9 s. So, I think the closest option is B: 2.5 ns.",
