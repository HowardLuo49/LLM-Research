The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for Doppler effect. The formula is:\n\nf' = f(v + vd) / (v + vs)\n\nwhere:\nf' = frequency of the echo\nf = frequency of the siren (600 Hz)\nv = speed of sound (350 m/s)\nvd = speed of the car (3.5 m/s)\nvs = speed of the wall towards which the car is moving (VD = -3.5 m/s, as it is in opposite direction)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nf' = 600 (350 + 3.5) / (350 - 3.5)\nf' = 600 (353.5) / 346.5\nf' = 612 Hz\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the echo heard by the driver is closest to 612 Hz, which is option D.",
