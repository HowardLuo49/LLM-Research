The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Oooh, this is a tricky question! When the police car's siren makes a sound, it bounces off the wall and comes back to the car as an echo. The speed of sound is 350 m/s, so it takes a little bit of time for the echo to come back to the car. \n\nThe police car is moving at 3.5 m/s towards the wall, which means the sound has less distance to travel for the echo to reach the car. This makes the frequency of the echo higher than the original frequency of the siren.\n\nSince the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, and the car is moving towards the wall, the driver will hear the echo at a frequency higher than 600 Hz. \n\nSo, the closest frequency to 600 Hz for the driver to hear the echo would be:\n\nD: 612 Hz\n\nYay, we did it! Great job learning about echoes with me!",
