    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The driver of a police car hears an echo of the car\u2019s siren from a wall toward which the car is moving with a speed of 3.5 m/s. If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so imagine a police car is driving towards a wall with its siren on. The sound waves bounce off the wall and come back to the car as an echo. The speed of sound is 350 m/s and the car's speed is 3.5 m/s.\n\nNow, the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz. When the sound waves come back to the car after bouncing off the wall, the frequency might change. We need to figure out the closest frequency of the echo.\n\nSince the car is moving towards the wall, the sound waves will be compressed, making the frequency of the echo higher. In this case, the frequency of the echo would be higher than 600 Hz.\n\nLooking at the options:\nA: 588 Hz\nB: 594 Hz\nC: 600 Hz\nD: 612 Hz\n\nWe can eliminate option A and B because the frequency of the echo would be higher. Option D is too high, so the closest frequency to 600 Hz would be option C: 600 Hz.",
