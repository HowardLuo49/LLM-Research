In a nonrelativistic, one-dimensional collision, a particle of mass 2m collides with a particle of mass m at rest. If the particles stick together after the collision, what fraction of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision?\nA: 0\nB: 1/4\nC: 1/3\nD: 1/2",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so in this problem, we have a collision between two particles. One particle has a mass of 2m and the other has a mass of m. The second particle is at rest before the collision. After the collision, the two particles stick together. \n\nTo find the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision, we need to calculate the initial and final kinetic energies. \n\nInitially, the mass 2m particle has kinetic energy (1/2)(2m)v^2 and the mass m particle has kinetic energy 0 since it is at rest. The total initial kinetic energy is (1/2)(2m)v^2.\n\nAfter the collision, the two particles stick together and move with a common velocity v'. The total final kinetic energy is (1/2)(3m)v'^2.\n\nTo find the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost, we need to calculate the difference between initial and final kinetic energy divided by initial kinetic energy:\n(Initial Ke - Final Ke) / Initial Ke = (1/2)(2m)v^2 - (1/2)(3m)v'^2 / (1/2)(2m)v^2\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n(-1/2)(m)v^2 / (1/2)(2m)v^2 = -1/2 / 1 = -1/2\n\nSo, the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is 1/2. The answer is D: 1/2.",
