A magnetic field is directed perpendicular to the plane of a circular coil of area 0.2 m^2 and 250 turns. If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the average induced EMF in the coil, we first need to calculate the induced EMF at the initial and final magnetic field strengths. \n\nThe induced EMF (\u03b5) in a coil of N turns with an area A, experiencing a change in magnetic flux (\u03a6) over time (\u0394t) is given by Faraday's law:\n\n\u03b5 = -N * \u0394\u03a6 / \u0394t\n\nWhere \u0394\u03a6 is the change in magnetic flux, which is equal to the change in magnetic field (\u0394B) * A.\n\nAt the initial magnetic field strength of 0.01 T, the initial magnetic flux is \u03a6i = B * A = 0.01 * 0.2 = 0.002 Wb.\n\nAt the final magnetic field strength of 0.06 T, the final magnetic flux is \u03a6f = 0.06 * 0.2 = 0.012 Wb.\n\nThe change in magnetic flux is \u0394\u03a6 = \u03a6f - \u03a6i = 0.012 - 0.002 = 0.01 Wb.\n\nPlugging in the values into the formula for induced EMF, we get:\n\n\u03b5 = -250 * 0.01 / 0.25 = -10 V\n\nSince the induced EMF is negative, it means that the direction of the induced current opposes the change in magnetic flux. Therefore, the correct average induced EMF in the coil is 10 V, which corresponds to option D.",
