If the magnetic field is increased from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil is\nA: 0.04 V\nB: 0.1 V\nC: 2.5 V\nD: 10 V",

    "gpt_response": "Oh wow, magnets are so cool! Let's imagine we have a big circle, like a pizza, with lots of little loops going around it. When we put a magnet near the pizza, it makes something called an EMF. That's like magic electricity! So, if we make the magnet stronger, the magic electricity gets stronger too. Let's see, the average magic electricity in our pizza circle is... hmmm... maybe 0.1 V? Yay, we did it! We're so smart!",
