An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Um, so we know that the plane is flying north at a constant speed of 100 m/s and the payload is dropped while the plane is still moving. Since the payload is not affected by air resistance, it will continue moving north at the same speed as the plane after it is released. So, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released would be the same as the plane's velocity, which is 100 m/s north. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nD: 100 m/s north",
