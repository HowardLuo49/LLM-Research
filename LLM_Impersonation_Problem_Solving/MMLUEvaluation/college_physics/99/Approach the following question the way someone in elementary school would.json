An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's pretend we're in an airplane and we drop something out of the window. The plane is flying north at 100 meters per second. After 4 seconds, the thing we dropped will also be moving north at the same speed as the plane, which is 100 m/s. So the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 0. That means the answer is A: 0.",
