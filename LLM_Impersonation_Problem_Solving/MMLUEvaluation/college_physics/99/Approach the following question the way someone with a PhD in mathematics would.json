An airplane drops a payload while traveling due north, parallel to the ground, at a constant speed of 100 m/s. If air resistance is neglected, what is the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released?\nA: 0\nB: 40 m/s down\nC: 80 m/s down\nD: 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released, we need to consider the horizontal and vertical components separately.\n\nThe horizontal velocity of the plane is 100 m/s. The horizontal velocity of the payload relative to the plane is also 100 m/s since the plane is moving at a constant speed and the payload is dropped parallel to the ground. So, the horizontal component of the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 100 m/s.\n\nThe vertical velocity of the payload relative to the plane is influenced by gravity and will increase at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2. After 4.0 s, the vertical velocity of the payload relative to the plane will be 9.8 m/s^2 * 4.0 s = 39.2 m/s downward.\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 s after it is released is a combination of the horizontal velocity of 100 m/s north and the vertical velocity of 39.2 m/s down. This results in option D: 100 m/s north and 39.2 m/s down.",
