Which of the following is true about any system that undergoes a reversible thermodynamic process?\nA: There are no changes in the internal energy of the system.\nB: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process.\nC: The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\nD: The entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "The correct answer is B: The temperature of the system remains constant during the process. This is because in a reversible thermodynamic process, the system is in equilibrium and the temperature does not change.",
