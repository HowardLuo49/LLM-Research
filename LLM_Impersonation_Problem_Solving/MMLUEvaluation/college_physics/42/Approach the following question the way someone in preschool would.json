Under certain conditions, a beam of electrons impinging on a crystal surface will diffract and a scattering pattern of the beam can be obtained. What is the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed in order to see the pattern? (Assume the lattice spacing of the crystal to be 0.4 nm.)\nA: 0.1 eV\nB: 1 eV\nC: 10 eV\nD: 100 eV",

The lattice spacing of the crystal is 0.4 nm. If we want to see the pattern, we need the kinetic energy of the electrons to be around 100 eV. So, the answer is D: 100 eV! Yay, we did it!",
