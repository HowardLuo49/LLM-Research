This is because a Hermitian operator is a self-adjoint operator where the eigenvalues can be interpreted as the possible values that a physical observable can take in a quantum mechanical system. Since physical observables must yield real results, it follows that the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator must be real. This property is a fundamental aspect of Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics and is a direct consequence of the spectral theorem for Hermitian operators.",
