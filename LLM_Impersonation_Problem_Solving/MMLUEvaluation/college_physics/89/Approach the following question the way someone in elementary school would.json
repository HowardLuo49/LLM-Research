    "gpt_response": "Hmm, well, Li++ has only 1 electron, while hydrogen has 1 electron in its normal state. That means Li++ is like a hydrogen atom without any electrons. So, since there's no difference in the number of protons between lithium and hydrogen, and since lithium is doubly ionized, the wavelengths in the emission spectrum should be decreased by a factor of 9. So, the answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9!",
