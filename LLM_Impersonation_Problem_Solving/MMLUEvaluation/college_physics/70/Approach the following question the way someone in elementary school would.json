    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in elementary school would. The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "So, the elevator cable broke and the elevator fell down, but then the emergency brakes stopped it before it hit the bottom. The question is asking how much heat the brakes need to get rid of to stop the elevator. If the elevator fell 100 meters, we need to figure out how much energy was lost. Since Potential Energy = mass x gravity x height, we can calculate Potential Energy = 1000 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 x 100 m. This gives us 980,000 J. So, the brakes must dissipate 980,000 J of heat to stop the elevator. Since that's not an option, the closest answer would be D: 1,000,000 J.",
