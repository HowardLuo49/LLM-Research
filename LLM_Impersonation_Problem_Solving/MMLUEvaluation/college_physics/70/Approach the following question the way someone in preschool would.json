The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 100 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 10,000 J\nD: 1,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The elevator is pretty heavy and was moving downward really fast. Then the brakes had to slow it down really quick before it reached the bottom. So the brakes had to work really hard and get really hot to stop the elevator. I think they had to use a lot of energy. I would say maybe, um, um, um, I think, hmm, I think maybe, um, c: 10,000 J.",
