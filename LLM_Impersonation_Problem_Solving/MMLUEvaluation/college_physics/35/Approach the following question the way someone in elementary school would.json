A student makes 10 one-second measurements of the disintegration of a sample of a long-lived radioactive isotope and obtains the following values: 3, 0, 2, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5. How long should the student count to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent?\nA: 80 s\nB: 160 s\nC: 2,000 s\nD: 5,000 s",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To find the average number of disintegrations per second, you add up all the measurements and divide by 10 (the number of measurements). So, (3+0+2+1+2+4+0+1+2+5) divided by 10 is 20/10 which equals 2 disintegrations per second. \n\nTo establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, you need to count for a time long enough that the uncertainty in the number of disintegrations is less than 1 percent of the total counted. The number of disintegrations in 1 percent of the total counted is 0.01*20 = 0.2. \n\nSince you count 2 disintegrations per second, you should count for 0.2/2 = 0.1 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the student should count for 0.1 seconds to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent. \n\nBut since that's not an option, the closest answer is A: 80 seconds.",
