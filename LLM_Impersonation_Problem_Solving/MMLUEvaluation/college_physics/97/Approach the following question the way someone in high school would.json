A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know the index of refraction for water is 1.33 and for oil is 1.5. The wavelength of light in the oil is 500 nm. To find the most strongly reflected wavelength, we can use the equation for reflection from a thin film: 2n1d/\u03bb = m + 1/2, where n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (water), d is the thickness of the film (500 nm), \u03bb is the wavelength of light in the film (500 nm), and m is an integer representing the order of the reflected light (0 for the most strongly reflected wavelength). \n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n2(1.33)(500 nm)/(500 nm) = m + 1/2\n2.66 = m + 1/2\nm = 2.16\n\nSince m must be an integer, the next closest integer to 2.16 is 2. Therefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is the same as the wavelength of light in the film, which is 500 nm. \n\nSo, the answer is:\nA: 500 nm",
