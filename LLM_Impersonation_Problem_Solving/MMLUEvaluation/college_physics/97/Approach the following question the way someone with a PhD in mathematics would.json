A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",

    "gpt_response": "To determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we first need to calculate the reflection coefficient at each wavelength using the Fresnel equations. The reflection coefficient is dependent on the incident angle, the refractive indices of the materials, and the wavelength of the light.\n\nIn this case, the incident angle is 0 degrees (normal incidence), the refractive index of water is 1.33, and the refractive index of oil is 1.5.\n\nUsing the Fresnel equations, we can calculate the reflection coefficients for each wavelength. The formula for the reflection coefficient is:\n\nr = (n1 - n2) / (n1 + n2)\n\nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the incident medium (water), and n2 is the refractive index of the transmitted medium (oil).\n\nFor each of the given wavelengths (500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm), we can calculate the reflection coefficient and determine which wavelength has the highest reflection coefficient. The wavelength with the highest reflection coefficient will correspond to the most strongly reflected wavelength. \n\nTherefore, to answer the question, we need to calculate the reflection coefficients for each wavelength and determine which one is the highest.",
