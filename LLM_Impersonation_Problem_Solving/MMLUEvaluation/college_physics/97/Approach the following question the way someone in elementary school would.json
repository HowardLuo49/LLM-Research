A thin (500 nm) layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. Of the following, the most strongly reflected wavelength is\nA: 500 nm\nB: 550 nm\nC: 600 nm\nD: 650 nm",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so when white light hits the oil on the water, some of it will be reflected back. The thickness of the oil layer will affect which colors get reflected the most. Since the oil is 500 nm thick, only a certain wavelength of light will be strongly reflected.\n \nLet's see, the formula to find the most strongly reflected wavelength is 2nOil * t = m * \u03bb, where nOil is the index of refraction of the oil, t is the thickness of the oil, m is an integer, and \u03bb is the wavelength of light.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n2 * 1.5 * 500 nm = m * \u03bb\n3 * 500 = m * \u03bb\n1500 = m * \u03bb\n\nSo, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 1500 nm. But wait, that's not one of the options given. Oops! I think I might have made a mistake. Let's try checking our work again. Let's plug in the values one more time and see if we get a different answer.\n\n2 * 1.5 * 500 = m * \u03bb\n1500 = m * \u03bb\n\nOkay, so it looks like I made a mistake in my calculations. The correct answer is the wavelength that is closest to 1500 nm, which is 600 nm. So, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 600 nm.\n \nAnswer: C: 600 nm",
