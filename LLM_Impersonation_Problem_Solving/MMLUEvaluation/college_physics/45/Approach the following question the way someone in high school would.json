A heat pump is to extract heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heat the environment indoors to 27\u00b0C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\nA: 500 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 1,100 J\nD: 2,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we're looking at a heat pump that needs to extract heat from outdoors at 7\u00b0C and bring it indoors to 27\u00b0C. To do this, we need to supply some work to the heat pump. For every 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, we need to supply the smallest amount of work.\n\nSo, let's think about this. The heat pump is essentially moving heat against its natural flow (from cold to hot). This requires work input. It's like pushing a boulder uphill - you need to supply energy to make it happen.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much work is needed for 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors. The most efficient heat pump would require the least amount of work.\n\nLooking at the options, I think the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately 1,000 J, which is option B.",
