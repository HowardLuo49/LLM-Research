A heat pump is to extract heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heat the environment indoors to 27\u00b0C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\nA: 500 J\nB: 1,000 J\nC: 1,100 J\nD: 2,000 J",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use the Carnot efficiency formula which relates the efficiency of a heat pump to the temperature of the hot and cold reservoirs.\n\nThe Carnot efficiency is given by:\n\u03b7 = 1 - Tc/Th\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the efficiency, Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir (7\u00b0C = 280 K), and Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir (27\u00b0C = 300 K).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\u03b7 = 1 - 280/300 = 1 - 28/30 = 1 - 0.9333 = 0.0667\n\nThis efficiency represents the fraction of heat supplied to the indoor environment that is extracted from the outdoor environment. Therefore, the amount of work required to deliver 15,000 J of heat indoors is given by:\nW = Q_hot / \u03b7 = 15,000 / 0.0667 \u2248 224,888.5 J \u2248 225,000 J\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately\nD: 2,000 J.",
