The particle decays really quickly in its rest frame, but if it moves in the lab frame at a speed of 0.60c, we need to figure out how far it will travel before decaying. Let's imagine the particle zooming around and having so much fun! Do you think it will travel 150 meters, 288 meters, 360 meters, or 450 meters before it decays?
