    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand time dilation due to special relativity. In the rest frame of the particle, the time it takes for the particle to decay is 2.0 ms. However, when observing the particle from a different frame of reference where it is moving at a velocity of v=0.60c, time dilation occurs.\n\nThe time dilation formula in special relativity is given by:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWhere:\nt' = time dilation (time observed in a different frame)\nt = time in the rest frame\nv = velocity of the particle\nc = speed of light\n\nPlugging in the values:\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - (0.60c)^2/c^2)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - 0.36)\nt' = 2.0 ms / sqrt(0.64)\nt' = 2.0 ms / 0.8\nt' = 2.5 ms\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the particle to decay in the lab frame is 2.5 ms. To find the distance traveled by the particle before decaying, we use the formula:\n\nd = v * t'\n\nWhere:\nd = distance traveled\nv = velocity of the particle\nt' = time observed in the lab frame\n\nPlugging in the values:\nd = 0.60c * 2.5 ms\nd = 0.60 * 3.00 x 10^8 m/s * 2.5 x 10^-3 s\nd = 4.5 x 10^8 m/s * 2.5 x 10^-3 s\nd = 1.125 x 10^6 m\nd = 1125 m\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the particle in the lab frame before decaying is 1125 meters.
