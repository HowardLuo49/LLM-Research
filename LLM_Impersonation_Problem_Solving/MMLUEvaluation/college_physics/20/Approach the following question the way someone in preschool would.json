Characteristic X rays, appearing as sharp lines on a continuous background, are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target. Which of the following processes results in the characteristic X rays?\nA: Electrons producing \u010cerenkov radiation\nB: Electrons colliding with phonons in the metal\nC: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nD: Electrons combining with protons to form neutrons",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Oh, I know this one! So when high-energy electrons go BOOM into a metal, they make special X rays that look like little lines. And do you know how they make these lines? It's because the electrons fill up spaces in the metal atoms! So the answer is C, electrons filling inner shell vacancies in the metal atoms. Yay, we learned something new today!",
