Characteristic X rays, appearing as sharp lines on a continuous background, are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target. Which of the following processes results in the characteristic X rays?\nA: Electrons producing \u010cerenkov radiation\nB: Electrons colliding with phonons in the metal\nC: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nD: Electrons combining with protons to form neutrons",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "C: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nThis is because when high-energy electrons hit the metal target, they can knock out electrons from the inner shells of the metal atoms. When other electrons fill in these empty spaces, they release characteristic X-rays.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to C?: C: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nThis is because when high-energy electrons hit the metal target, they can knock out electrons from the inner shells of the metal atoms. When other electrons fill in these empty spaces, they release characteristic X-rays.",
