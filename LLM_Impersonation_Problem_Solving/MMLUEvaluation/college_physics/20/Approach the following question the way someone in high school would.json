Characteristic X rays, appearing as sharp lines on a continuous background, are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target. Which of the following processes results in the characteristic X rays?\nA: Electrons producing \u010cerenkov radiation\nB: Electrons colliding with phonons in the metal\nC: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\nD: Electrons combining with protons to form neutrons",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. When high-energy electrons hit a metal target, they can knock out inner shell electrons in the metal atoms. This creates vacancies in the inner shells, which are then filled by outer-shell electrons. When these outer-shell electrons drop down to fill the vacancies, they release energy in the form of characteristic X rays. So, I think the correct answer is C: Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms.",

When high-energy electrons hit a metal target, they can knock out inner shell electrons in the metal atoms. This creates vacancies in the inner shells, which are then filled by outer-shell electrons.
