    "gpt_response": "Alrighty, so imagine you have a big round cookie rolling down a slide. At first, it's not moving at all, so all of its energy is just sitting there. But as it starts rolling, it gets some kinetic energy - that's like when you're running around and feeling super energetic.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much of that kinetic energy is the kind that comes from the cookie spinning around as it rolls down the slide. If you think about it, when you're running, only part of your energy comes from your spinning. So, if we pretend the cookie's energy is split into two parts - one for its spinning and one for its moving - then what fraction of its total energy is the spinning part?\n\nHmm... Let's think about it. The spinning part is like the special twist that the cookie has that makes it different from just going straight. So, I would guess it's like half of the energy that is all about the spinning. And since we're talking about total energy here, that means the spinning part is 1/2 of the whole thing.\n\nSo, I'm gonna go with C: 1/2!",
