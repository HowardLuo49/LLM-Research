    "gpt_response": "First, let's imagine a fun spinning wheel going down a slide! Whee! As the wheel goes faster and faster, some of its energy comes from spinning around, and some comes from moving forward. If we imagine that the wheel is happy and wants to share its energy equally between spinning around and moving forward, then it would have half spinning energy and half moving forward energy. So, the answer is C: 1/2! Yay for spinning wheels!",
