    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we first need to understand the concept of rotational kinetic energy and how it relates to the total kinetic energy of a rolling disk. \n\nThe total kinetic energy of an object can be broken down into two components: translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. For a rolling disk, the total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy (1/2 * m * v^2) and the rotational kinetic energy (1/2 * I * \u03c9^2), where m is the mass of the disk, v is the linear velocity of the center of mass, I is the moment of inertia of the disk, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the disk.\n\nWhen the disk is rolling without slipping, the linear velocity of the center of mass (v) and the angular velocity of the disk (\u03c9) are related by v = r * \u03c9, where r is the radius of the disk. \n\nTo find the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we need to compare the rotational kinetic energy to the total kinetic energy. \n\nSince the disk is rolling down an inclined plane without slipping, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. At the bottom of the incline, all the potential energy is converted to only kinetic energy, so it can be assumed that the total kinetic energy of the disk at the bottom of the incline is equal to the initial potential energy.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the disk at the bottom of the incline can be calculated using the conservation of energy principle. This involves calculating the translational kinetic energy (1/2 * m * v^2) and rotational kinetic energy (1/2 * I * \u03c9^2) at the bottom of the incline.\n\nHowever, since this question is asking for a fraction in terms of rotational kinetic energy, we can simplify the calculations by noting that at the bottom of the incline, the disk will have both translational and rotational kinetic energy, and these energies will be in the ratio of 1:1. Therefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is 1/2, which corresponds to option C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1/2.",
