    "gpt_response": "To deduce the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor, one would typically measure the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a property that characterizes the type of charge carriers in a material, whether they are positive (holes) or negative (electrons). By measuring the Hall coefficient, one can determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor. Specific heat, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity are important properties of a material, but they are not directly related to determining the sign of the charge carriers.",
