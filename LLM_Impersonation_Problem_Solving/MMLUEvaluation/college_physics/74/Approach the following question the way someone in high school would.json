    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in high school would. The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know the elevator fell a distance of 100 meters, the weight of the elevator is 1,000 kg, and it started from rest. To calculate the heat that the brakes must dissipate, we can use the formula: \n\nheat = mgh\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the elevator (1,000 kg)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2)\nh = distance fallen (100 m)\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\nheat = 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m\nheat = 980,000 J \n\nTherefore, the amount of heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 980,000 J, which is closest to 1,000,000 J (option C).",
