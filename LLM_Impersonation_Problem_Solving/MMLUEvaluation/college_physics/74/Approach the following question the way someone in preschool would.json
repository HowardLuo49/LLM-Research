    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone in preschool would. The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Wow! The elevator is falling down! Oh no! But the brakes stop it just in time. Phew! Now we need to figure out how much heat the brakes must get rid of. Let's see, the elevator fell 100 meters and it weighs 1,000 kg. So, to find out how much heat the brakes need to dissipate, we can use the formula: \nHeat = mass x gravity x height \nHeat = 1,000 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 x 100 m \nHeat = 1,000,000 J \nSo the answer is C: 1,000,000 J. Yay! The elevator is safe now.",
