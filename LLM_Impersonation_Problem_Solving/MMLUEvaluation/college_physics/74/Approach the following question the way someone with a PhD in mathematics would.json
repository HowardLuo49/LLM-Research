The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\nA: 10,000 J\nB: 100,000 J\nC: 1,000,000 J\nD: 10,000,000 J",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to calculate the gravitational potential energy that the elevator possesses at the top of the shaft.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy, U, is given by the equation:\nU = mgh\n\nWhere:\nm = mass of the elevator (1000 kg)\ng = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2)\nh = height of the shaft (100 m)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nU = 1000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 100 m\nU = 981,000 J\n\nThis is the amount of energy that the elevator initially possessed in the form of gravitational potential energy. When the elevator reaches the bottom of the shaft, all of this energy is converted into kinetic energy. To bring the elevator to rest, the emergency brakes must dissipate this kinetic energy in the form of heat.\n\nThe heat that the brakes must dissipate is equal to the initial potential energy of the elevator:\nHeat = 981,000 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1,000,000 J.",
