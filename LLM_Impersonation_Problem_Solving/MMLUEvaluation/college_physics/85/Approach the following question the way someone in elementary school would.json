A photon strikes an electron of mass m that is initially at rest, creating an electron-positron pair. The photon is destroyed and the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. The energy of the photon was\nA: mc^2\nB: 2mc^2\nC: 3mc^2\nD: 4mc^2",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so like, a photon hits an electron and then it turns into an electron-positron pair. The positron and two electrons all start moving together in the same direction. We need to figure out how much energy the photon had in the first place. Um, I think the answer must be D: 4mc^2 because the total energy of everything after is equal to the energy of the photon. So, yeah, that's my final answer!",
