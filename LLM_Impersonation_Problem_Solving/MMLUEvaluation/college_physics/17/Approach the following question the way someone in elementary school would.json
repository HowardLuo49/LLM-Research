A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have a spring, a wall, and a table. The mass on the spring is 0.30 kg. It moves 0.030 m away from its starting point and then goes back through its starting point at a speed of 0.040 m/s. We want to find the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nHmm, let's see. The total mechanical energy of a system is the sum of its kinetic energy (energy due to motion) and its potential energy (stored energy). Since there is no friction, the total mechanical energy stays the same throughout the motion.\n\nIn this case, the mass on the spring has kinetic energy when it's moving and potential energy when it's stretched away from its starting point. The total mechanical energy will be the sum of these two.\n\nTo find the kinetic energy, we use the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the speed. Plugging in the values, we get KE = 0.5 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.00024 kg*m^2/s^2 = 0.24 J.\n\nTo find the potential energy, we use the formula PE = 0.5 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium. Since the spring is massless, the spring constant k won't change. Plugging in the values, we get PE = 0.5 * k * (0.030 m)^2.\n\nSince the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, we have: Total energy = KE + PE = 0.24 J + 0.0000225 k * m^2/s^2 = 0.24 J + 0.0000225 J = 0.24 J\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.24 J, which is the same as 0.24 mJ. So the answer is A: 0.24 mJ.",
