A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have a mass attached to a spring and we're trying to find the total mechanical energy of the system. First, we need to remember that the total mechanical energy of a system is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy.\n\nWe know that the mass has a speed of 0.040 m/s at its equilibrium position, so the kinetic energy of the system at this point is 0.5 * mass * velocity^2. Plugging in the values, we get 0.5 * 0.3 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.00024 J.\n\nNext, we need to find the potential energy of the system. Since the spring is massless and there is no friction, the potential energy is only due to the spring's compression. The potential energy of a spring is given by 0.5 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from equilibrium. We are given that the displacement is 0.030 m, so we just need to find the spring constant.\n\nTo find the spring constant, we can use the equation for the period of a mass-spring system: T = 2\u03c0\u221a(m/k). Given that the period of the system is 0.75 s, and the mass is 0.30 kg, we can solve for the spring constant. \n\nPlugging in the values, we get 0.75 s = 2\u03c0\u221a(0.30 kg / k). Solving for k, we get k = 11.09 N/m.\n\nNow that we have the spring constant, we can find the potential energy: 0.5 * 11.09 N/m * (0.030 m)^2 = 0.00496875 J.\n\nAdding the kinetic and potential energy together, we get 0.00024 J + 0.00496875 J = 0.00520875 J. Converting this to millijoules, we get 5.20875 mJ. \n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.52 mJ, which is closest to option C: 0.48 mJ.",
