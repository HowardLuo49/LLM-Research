A mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring and rests on a table. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\nA: 0.24 mJ\nB: 0.38 mJ\nC: 0.48 mJ\nD: 0.75 mJ",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the kinetic energy and potential energy of the mass-spring system. \n\nThe potential energy of a spring is given by the equation U = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. In this case, the displacement is 0.030 m, so the potential energy when the mass is displaced is U = (1/2)(k)(0.030)^2. \n\nThe kinetic energy of the mass is given by the equation K = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the speed of the mass at the equilibrium position. Substituting in the values given (m = 0.30 kg, v = 0.040 m/s), we get K = (1/2)(0.30)(0.040)^2. \n\nThe total mechanical energy (E) of the system is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies: E = U + K.\n\nBy substituting the values of potential energy and kinetic energy, we get E = (1/2)(k)(0.030)^2 + (1/2)(0.30)(0.040)^2. \n\nTo solve for the total mechanical energy, we need to know the value of the spring constant 'k'. Without this value, we are unable to calculate the total mechanical energy. Therefore, the correct answer would be: Insufficient information provided to calculate the total mechanical energy.",
