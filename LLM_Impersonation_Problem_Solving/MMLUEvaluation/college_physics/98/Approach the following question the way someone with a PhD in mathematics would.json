A nonrelativistic particle with a charge twice that of an electron moves through a uniform magnetic field. The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\nA: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB: 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC: 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD: 5.0 * 10^-21 kg",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first determine the equation for the cyclotron frequency of a nonrelativistic particle moving through a magnetic field. The cyclotron frequency is given by:\n\nf = qB / (2\u03c0m)\n\nwhere:\n- f = cyclotron frequency\n- q = charge of the particle \n- B = magnetic field strength\n- m = mass of the particle\n\nGiven that the particle's charge is twice that of an electron, we can represent the charge as 2e, where e is the elementary charge. Therefore, q = 2e.\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\n1600 = (2e)(\u03c0/4) / (2\u03c0m)\n\nSimplify and solve for m:\n\n1600 = (e/2)(1/2)\n1600 = (1/2)(c)(1/2)\n1600 = c/4\n1600 * 4 = c\n6400 = c\n\nTherefore, the mass of the particle is 6400 kg.
