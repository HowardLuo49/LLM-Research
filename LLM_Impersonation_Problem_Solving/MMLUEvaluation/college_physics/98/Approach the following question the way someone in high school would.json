The field has a strength of \u03c0/4 tesla and is perpendicular to the velocity of the particle. What is the particle\u2019s mass if it has a cyclotron frequency of 1,600 hertz?\nA: 2.5 * 10^-23 kg\nB: 1.2 * 10^-22 kg\nC: 3.3 * 10^-22 kg\nD: 5.0 * 10^-21 kg",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Umm okay, so first we know that the cyclotron frequency formula is f = (qB)/(2\u03c0m), where f is the frequency, q is the charge of the particle, B is the magnetic field strength, and m is the mass of the particle. We also know the charge of the particle is twice that of an electron, so it's 2e. And the magnetic field strength is \u03c0/4. We want to find the mass.\n\nSo, the formula will be 1600 = (2e * (\u03c0/4))/(2\u03c0m). We can simplify that to 1600 = e/2m. We know that the mass we're looking for is 2 times the mass of an electron, so it's 2 * me.\n\nNow it's just algebra. We can rewrite the equation as 1600 = e/(2 * 2me). Then we solve for me, which should give us 2.5 * 10^-23 kg. So, the answer is A.",
