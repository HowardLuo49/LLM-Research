To create an n-type semiconductor, we need a dopant that introduces additional electrons into the germanium crystal structure. This results in an excess of negative charge carriers (electrons) in the crystal, giving it an n-type conductivity.\n\nPhosphorus (P), antimony (Sb), and arsenic (As) are common n-type dopants that have five valence electrons. When introduced into the germanium crystal structure, these atoms can easily donate an extra electron, creating an excess of electrons for conduction.\n\nBoron (B), on the other hand, is a common p-type dopant. Boron has only three valence electrons, making it easier for the boron atom to accept an electron, leading to a deficiency of electrons (also known as holes) which contribute to p-type conductivity.\n\nTherefore, the ion that CANNOT be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor is D: Boron (B).",
