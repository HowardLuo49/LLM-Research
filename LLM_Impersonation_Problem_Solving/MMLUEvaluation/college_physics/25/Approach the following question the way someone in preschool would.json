Let's look at our options:\n\nA: As - this ion has an extra electron, so it could work!\nB: P - this ion also has an extra electron, so it could work too!\nC: Sb - this ion has an extra electron, so it could work as well!\nD: B - hmmm, this ion doesn't have an extra electron, so I don't think it will work for making an n-type semiconductor.\n\nSo, the answer is D: B!",
