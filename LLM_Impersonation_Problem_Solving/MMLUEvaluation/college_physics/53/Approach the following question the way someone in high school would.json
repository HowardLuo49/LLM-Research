The mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, and the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. Which of the following is true of forces F_A and F_B?\nA: F_B = 1/4 F_A\nB: F_B = 1/2 F_A\nC: F_B = 2F_A\nD: F_B = 4F_A",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, and the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. This means that the force acting on object B (F_B) must be greater than the force acting on object A (F_A), since force is equal to mass times acceleration.\n\nLet's simplify this: \nSince the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A, we can say that:\n\na_B = 2a_A\n\nNow, we also know that the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A. Therefore:\n\nm_B = 2m_A\n\nUsing Newton's second law (F = ma), we can substitute the values of mass and acceleration to solve for the forces acting on object A and object B:\n\nF_A = m_A * a_A \nF_B = m_B * a_B\n\nSince F_B = m_B * a_B and F_A = m_A * a_A, we know that F_B = 2m_A * 2a_A, or F_B = 4(m_A * a_A), which is equivalent to 4F_A. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D: F_B = 4F_A.",
