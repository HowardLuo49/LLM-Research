The mass of object B is twice the mass of object A, and the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. Which of the following is true of forces F_A and F_B?\nA: F_B = 1/4 F_A\nB: F_B = 1/2 F_A\nC: F_B = 2F_A\nD: F_B = 4F_A",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that the mass of object B is twice the mass of object A and the acceleration of object B is two times that of object A. This means that object B is moving faster because it has more acceleration. \n\nNow, if object B is moving faster, that means the force acting on it must also be greater. So, the correct answer is C: F_B = 2F_A. This means that the force acting on object B is twice the force acting on object A.",
