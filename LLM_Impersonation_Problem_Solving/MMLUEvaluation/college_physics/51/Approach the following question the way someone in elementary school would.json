    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay... so to do spectroscopy, we need a laser that can produce different colors of light. I remember learning that the visible light range has lots of different colors. So, which type of laser can make different colors? I think a dye laser might be able to do that because dyes can make different colors. So, my answer would be A: a dye laser!",
