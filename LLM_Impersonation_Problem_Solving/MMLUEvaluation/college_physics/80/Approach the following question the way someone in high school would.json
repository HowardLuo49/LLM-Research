The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Um, so the question is saying that the Sun has a temperature of 6,000 K and emits light at a wavelength of 500 nm. We need to figure out at what wavelength a body with a temperature of 300 K would emit the most light. I think we can use Wien's Law for this, which says that the wavelength at which the peak intensity occurs is inversely proportional to the temperature. So, since the temperature is lower for the body, the peak wavelength would be longer. \n\nI am going to guess that the answer is C: 10 mm since a lower temperature would mean a longer wavelength based on Wien's Law.",
