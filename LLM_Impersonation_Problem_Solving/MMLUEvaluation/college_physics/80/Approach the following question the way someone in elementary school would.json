The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay let's see. So the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and its thermal spectrum reaches a maximum near 500 nm. That means that for something with a lower temperature, like 300 K, the wavelength where the thermal spectrum reaches a maximum would be longer. So, the answer is likely one of the ones with \"mm\" in it. But let's think about it some more...ah, yes! The correct answer is D: 100 mm.",
