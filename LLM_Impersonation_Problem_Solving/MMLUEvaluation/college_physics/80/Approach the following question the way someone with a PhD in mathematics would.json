The surface of the Sun has a temperature close to 6,000 K and it emits a blackbody (Planck) spectrum that reaches a maximum near 500 nm. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, at what wavelength would the thermal spectrum reach a maximum?\nA: 10:00 PM\nB: 100 Pm\nC: 10 mm\nD: 100 mm",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum of a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K reaches a maximum, we can use Wien's displacement law. \n\nWien's displacement law states that the wavelength at which the thermal spectrum of a blackbody reaches a maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature of the body. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\u03bb_peak = b / T\n\nwhere \u03bb_peak is the wavelength at which the spectrum reaches a maximum, T is the temperature of the body, and b is Wien's displacement constant, equal to 2.898 x 10^-3 m*K.\n\nSubstitute the temperature of 300 K into the equation:\n\n\u03bb_peak = (2.898 x 10^-3) / 300\n\u03bb_peak = 9.66 x 10^-6 m\n\nConverting the wavelength to nanometers (1 m = 10^9 nm):\n\n\u03bb_peak = 9.66 x 10^-6 m * 10^9 nm/m\n\u03bb_peak = 9.66 x 10^3 nm\n\u03bb_peak = 9660 nm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed, but it would be approximately 9660 nm.",
