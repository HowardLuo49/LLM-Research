Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2.

    "gpt_response": "To calculate the total radiation force exerted on the surface, we need to first determine the total power incident on the surface. This can be calculated by multiplying the solar flux by the area of the surface:\n\nPower = Solar flux * Area\nPower = 1000 W/m^2 * 3 m^2\nPower = 3000 W\n\nNext, we need to consider that the radiation force exerted on a completely reflecting surface is equal to twice the power incident on the surface divided by the speed of light:\n\nForce = (2 * Power) / c\nForce = (2 * 3000 W) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\nForce = 6 x 10^3 J/s / 3 x 10^8 m/s\nForce = 2 x 10^-5 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2 x 10^-5 N.",
