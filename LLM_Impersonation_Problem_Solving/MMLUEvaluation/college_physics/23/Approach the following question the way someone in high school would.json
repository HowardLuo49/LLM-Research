Assume that the solar flux at Earth\u2019s surface is 1,000 W/m^2 and that the sunlight is normal to a completely reflecting surface with an area of 3 m^2. What is the total radiation force exerted on the surface?\nA: 2 x 10^-6 N\nB: 1 x 10^-5 N\nC: 2 x 10^-5 N\nD: 3 N",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to calculate the total power hitting the surface by multiplying the solar flux by the area. So, 1,000 W/m^2 x 3 m^2 = 3,000 W.\n\nSince the power is equal to the rate of change of momentum, we can calculate the force by dividing the power by the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s.\n\nSo, the force exerted on the surface is 3,000 W / 3 x 10^8 m/s = 1 x 10^-5 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 1 x 10^-5 N.",
