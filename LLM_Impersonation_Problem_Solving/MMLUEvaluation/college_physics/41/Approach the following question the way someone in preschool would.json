If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "Wow! Let's play a fun game with lights and numbers! Imagine we have a special machine called a Michelson interferometer, and it has a gas cell inside. When the gas cell is empty, we see 100 pretty lines called fringes. We can count them like we count stars in the sky! The light we use to see the fringes is from a cool laser, and it has a special color called red with a wavelength of 632.2 nm. Isn't that neat?\n\nNow, if we put air back into the gas cell, the fringes might change. We can use math to figure out the index of refraction of the gas. The answer is really small and tricky, but it's fun to play with numbers! Can you help me find the right one out of these choices: \nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968\n\nLet's pick the best one together!",
