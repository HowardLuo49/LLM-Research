If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so like, the question is asking us to find the index of refraction of the original gas in the gas cell, right? And we know that the optical path length is 10 cm, the wavelength of the laser is 632.2 nm, and 100 fringes are counted when the gas cell is evacuated.\n\nFrom the interferometer, we know that the number of fringes is related to the change in optical path length, which is related to the change in the index of refraction. Since 100 fringes are counted, that means there was a change in the index of refraction as the gas cell was evacuated.\n\nTo find the index of refraction of the original gas, we can use the formula:\n\n\u0394n = (100 * \u03bb)/2L\n\u0394n = (100 * 632.2 nm)/(2 * 10 cm)\n\n\u0394n = 31610 nm/cm\n\u0394n = 0.00003161\n\nSo, the index of refraction of the original gas is 1 + \u0394n, which is approximately 1.00032. Therefore, the answer is B.",
