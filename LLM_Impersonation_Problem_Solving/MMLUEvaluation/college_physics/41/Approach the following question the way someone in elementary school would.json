If the light source for the interferometer is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm, then 100 fringes are counted as the gas cell is evacuated. What is the index of refraction of the original gas?\nA: 1.00063\nB: 1.00032\nC: 1.00016\nD: 0.99968",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so there's this thing called a Michelson interferometer and it has to do with light and stuff. So, there's this gas cell in one part of the interferometer and when the gas is gone, they count fringes. The wavelength of the light is 632.2 nm and they count 100 fringes. The question is asking what's the index of refraction of the original gas. Um, I think the answer might be A, which is 1.00063.",
