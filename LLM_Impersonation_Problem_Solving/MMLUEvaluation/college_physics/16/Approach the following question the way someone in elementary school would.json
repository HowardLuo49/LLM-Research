Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Yay, we get to talk about helium atoms! So, there are two different excited states called para and ortho. The ortho state has lower energy than the para state. This can be understood because of the Pauli exclusion principle. That's the rule that says no two electrons can have the same quantum state. So, in the ortho state, the electrons have parallel spins, which means they can fit into different quantum states and have lower energy. It's like a rule to make sure everything stays balanced in the atom. Isn't that cool?",
