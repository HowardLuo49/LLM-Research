Excited states of the helium atom can be characterized as para- (antiparallel electron spins) and ortho- (parallel electron spins). The observation that an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state can be understood in terms of which of the following?\nA: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle\nB: The Pauli exclusion principle\nC: The Bohr model of the atom\nD: Nuclear hyperfine coupling",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "B: The Pauli exclusion principle\n\nThis is because the Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons within an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. In the case of the helium atom, when the electron spins are parallel (ortho- state), they must occupy different energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This results in a lower energy state compared to the para- state where the electron spins are antiparallel.",
