And since the emission spectrum of Li++ is identical to that of hydrogen, that must mean the wavelengths are related somehow. \n\nSo, if Li++ has a nuclear charge of 3, that means its force of attraction on the electrons is stronger than hydrogen's, right? Maybe that affects the wavelengths somehow.\n\nLooking at the choices, I see they're all related to factors of 9, so maybe it has something to do with that. I'm thinking the correct answer is A: decreased by a factor of 9 because Li++ is more positively charged than hydrogen, so maybe that would affect the wavelengths by making them smaller.",
