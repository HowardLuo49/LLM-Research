    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, let's first understand the similarities between the emission spectra of hydrogen and doubly ionized lithium atoms. The emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy differences between its electron orbitals.\n\nFor hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the formula:\n\nE = -13.6 eV * Z^2 / n^2\n\nwhere Z = atomic number and n = principal quantum number.\n\nFor lithium with two electrons removed (doubly ionized), Z = 3 and n = 1, 2, 3, ... . \n\nNow, since we are comparing the emission spectrum of Li++ to that of hydrogen, we need to consider the effect of the different atomic numbers on the emission spectra. \n\nThe relationships between the different energy levels of the two atoms can be calculated by the formula:\n\n\u03bb = hc / E\n\nwhere \u03bb = wavelength, h = Planck's constant, c = speed of light, and E = energy.\n\nTherefore, to compare the wavelengths of the emission spectra of hydrogen and doubly ionized lithium, we need to consider the differences in the energy levels of the two atoms.\n\nSubstitute the values of Z and n for hydrogen and doubly ionized lithium into the energy formula and then express the wavelengths of the two atoms in terms of their respective atomic numbers.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, it will be determined that the wavelengths of the emission spectra of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ are decreased by a factor of 81 compared to those of a hydrogen atom.
