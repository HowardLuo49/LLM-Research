Well, scientists like to look at colors too, but they call them wavelengths. They found that the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ is the same as a hydrogen atom, but the wavelengths are different. They found that the wavelengths are much smaller for the lithium atom compared to the hydrogen atom. So, if we use our colorful imaginations, we can say that the wavelengths are... decreased by a factor of 9! Yay for colors!",
