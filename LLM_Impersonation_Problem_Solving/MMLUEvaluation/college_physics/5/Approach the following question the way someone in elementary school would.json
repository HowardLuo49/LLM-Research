    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, this is a tough question for someone in elementary school like me. Let's see... I remember that the total spin quantum number for an electron can be either +1/2 or -1/2. And since neutral nitrogen has 7 electrons, we need to figure out the total spin of all those electrons together. So, if we add up all the spin quantum numbers for the electrons in nitrogen, we get:\n\n1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 7/2\n\nBut wait, since the total spin quantum number can only be a whole number or a half number, we need to round 7/2 to the nearest half number. And that would be 4, which is the same as 2/2. So, the answer is D: 5/2. \n\nI hope I got that right!",
