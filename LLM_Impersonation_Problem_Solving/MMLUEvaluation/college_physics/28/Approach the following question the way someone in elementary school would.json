A proton moves in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V. The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton\u2019s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be\nA: deflected in the +x-direction\nB: deflected in the -x-direction\nC: deflected in the +y-direction\nD: deflected in the -y-direction",

    "gpt_response": "Once upon a time, a little proton started moving up, up, up in the +z-direction after going through a big potential difference V. It then went into a place with an electric field in the +x-direction and a magnetic field in the +y-direction, but it kept on going straight without getting pushed or pulled.\n\nNow, if we did the whole thing again but with a potential difference of 2V, what would happen to the proton? Would it go to the right in the +x-direction, go to the left in the -x-direction, go up in the +y-direction, or go down in the -y-direction?\n\nWell, since the proton didn't get deflected the first time, we can probably assume it won't get deflected the second time either. So the answer is, the proton would still keep on going straight in the +z-direction. So the answer is none of the above!",
