The proton then passes through a region with a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction, but the proton\u2019s trajectory is not affected. If the experiment were repeated using a potential difference of 2V, the proton would then be\nA: deflected in the +x-direction\nB: deflected in the -x-direction\nC: deflected in the +y-direction\nD: deflected in the -y-direction",

    "gpt_response": "Whoa! Let's imagine we're on a fun adventure with a little proton friend. The proton is zooming in the +z-direction after being pushed by a special force called potential difference V. Then, the proton goes through a place with an electric field in the +x-direction and a magnetic field in the +y-direction. But guess what? Our proton friend just keeps on going straight, like a little superhero flying through it all! \nNow, let's think about what happens when we use double the power, a potential difference of 2V. If we double the power, do you think the proton will get deflected and go in a different way? Will it go to the +x or -x direction, or maybe the +y or -y direction? Let's guess together!",
