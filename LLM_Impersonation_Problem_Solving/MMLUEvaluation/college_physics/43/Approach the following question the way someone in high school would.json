    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of kinetic energy and how it is divided between translational and rotational kinetic energy. When a disk rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, it has both translational kinetic energy (related to its linear motion) and rotational kinetic energy (related to its spinning motion).\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, we can determine that the kinetic energy is evenly distributed between translational and rotational kinetic energy.
