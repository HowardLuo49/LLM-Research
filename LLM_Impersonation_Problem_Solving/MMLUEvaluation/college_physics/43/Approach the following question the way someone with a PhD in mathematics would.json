After some time, what fraction of the disk\u2019s total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy?\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the rotational and translational kinetic energies of the disk. The total kinetic energy of the disk is the sum of these two forms of kinetic energy.\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy of a rotating object is given by the formula KE_rot = (1/2) * I * w^2, where I is the moment of inertia of the object and w is the angular velocity. For a disk of radius R and mass M, the moment of inertia is I = (1/2) * M * R^2.\n\nThe translational kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula KE_trans = (1/2) * M * v^2, where v is the linear velocity of the object.\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, the relationship between the linear velocity v and the angular velocity w is v = R * w. Therefore, we can rewrite the rotational kinetic energy in terms of linear velocity as KE_rot = (1/4) * M * v^2.\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the disk is then KE_total = KE_rot + KE_trans = (1/4) * M * v^2 + (1/2) * M * v^2 = (3/4) * M * v^2.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.\n\nSo the answer is B: 1/3.",
