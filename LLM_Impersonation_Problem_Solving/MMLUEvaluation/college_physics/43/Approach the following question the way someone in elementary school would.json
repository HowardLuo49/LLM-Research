Now, the question is asking how much of the energy comes from the spinning around part and not just from moving down the hill. Hmm, let me think... I remember that for a solid disk, the rotational kinetic energy is half of the total kinetic energy. So, that means the answer is C: 1/2! Yay, we figured it out!",
