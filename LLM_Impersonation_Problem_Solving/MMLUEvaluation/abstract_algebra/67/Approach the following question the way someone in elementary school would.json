One of those rules is that if you have two things in the group and you combine them using the group operation, the result also has to be in the group. Another rule is that every thing in the group has to have an inverse in the group. Also, if you have two things in the group, when you multiply one by the inverse of the other, the result has to be in the group. Lastly, the group has to have the identity element in it.",
