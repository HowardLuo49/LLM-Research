    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine the dimension of the extension field over the base field. \n\nFirst, note that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*3*3) = sqrt(2)sqrt(3)sqrt(3) = sqrt(2)sqrt(3)\u2208 Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3)). Therefore, Q(sqrt(18)) = Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3)).\n\nSince Q(sqrt(2)) is a degree 2 extension over Q (irreducible polynomial x^2 - 2), and Q(sqrt(3)) is also a degree 2 extension over Q (irreducible polynomial x^2 - 3), the composite field Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3)) is a degree 2 extension over both Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)), according to the Tower Law of Field Extensions.\n\nTherefore, Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(18)) is a degree 2 extension over Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3)), which is already a degree 2 extension over Q. This means the total degree of the given field extension over Q is 2*2 = 4.\n\nSo the answer is B: 4.",
