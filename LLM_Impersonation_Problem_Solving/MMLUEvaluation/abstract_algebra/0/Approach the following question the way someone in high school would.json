    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what the degree of the field extension means. The degree of a field extension is the dimension of the field extension as a vector space over the base field. In this case, our base field is Q, the rational numbers.\n\nTo find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine the dimension of the field extension as a vector space over Q.\n\nNotice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3). This means that we can express sqrt(18) in terms of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). Therefore, the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nWe know that the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4, since the basis {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} spans this extension. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: 4.",
