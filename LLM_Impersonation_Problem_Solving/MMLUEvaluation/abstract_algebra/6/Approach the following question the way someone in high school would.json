And Statement 2 is saying that the homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. \n\nI think Statement 1 is true because it makes sense that a homomorphic image of a group would be isomorphic to a factor group of that group. And for Statement 2, it sounds like it's saying the same thing as Statement 1 but in a different way. So I think both statements are true. So my answer is A: True, True.",
