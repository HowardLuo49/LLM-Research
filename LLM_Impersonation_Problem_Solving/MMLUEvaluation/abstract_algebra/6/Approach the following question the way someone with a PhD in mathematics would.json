    "gpt_response": "Both statements are true. \nTo prove statement 1: Let f: G \u2192 H be a homomorphism where H is a group. By the First Isomorphism Theorem, G/ker(f) is isomorphic to Im(f), which is a homomorphic image of G. Therefore, every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. \nTo prove statement 2: Let K be a normal subgroup of G. Consider the canonical projection map \u03c0: G \u2192 G/K defined by \u03c0(g) = gK. This is a homomorphism and the factor group G/K is isomorphic to the image of this homomorphism, which is a homomorphic image of G. Therefore, the homomorphic images of G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. \nThus, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
