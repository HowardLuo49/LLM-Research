    "gpt_response": "First, we need to use the given values of T(1, 0) and T(0, 1) to figure out a pattern. \n\nWhen T(1, 0) = 3, that means when we plug in x = 1 and y = 0 into the function T, we get an output of 3. \n\nLikewise, when T(0, 1) = -5, that means when we plug in x = 0 and y = 1 into the function T, we get an output of -5. \n\nNow, let's see if we can determine a pattern. \n\nWhen we plug in x = 1 and y = 0, we get an output of 3. \n\nSo, if we plug in x = -3 and y = 0, that means we just need to make x negative. \n\nLet's try that. T(-3,0) = T(1,0) * -3 = 3 * -3 = -9.\n\nNow, when we plug in x = 0 and y = 1, we get an output of -5. \n\nSo, if we plug in x = 0 and y = 2, that means we just need to make y double. \n\nLet's try that. T(0,2) = T(0,1) * 2 = -5 * 2 = -10. \n\nTherefore, T(-3,2) = -9 + (-10) = -19. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: -19.",
