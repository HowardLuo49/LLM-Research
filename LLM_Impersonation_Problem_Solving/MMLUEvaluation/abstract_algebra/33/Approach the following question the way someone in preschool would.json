Now, let's look at the options.\n\nA: g = g^-1 for every g in G\nHmm, I know that in an abelian group, g = g^-1 may not necessarily be true because that's only guaranteed in a group with elements that are their own inverses.\n\nB: g = g^2 for every g in G\nOh wow, g = g^2 wouldn't be true for every element in an abelian group because not all elements square to themselves necessarily.\n\nC: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\nWell, since G is abelian, I know that (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 is true! That's because in an abelian group, the order of elements doesn't matter when multiplying them together. Yay!\n\nD: G is of finite order\nI don't think being abelian necessarily means that G has to be of finite order. So, I don't think this is true.\n\nSo, the TRUE statement for G is C: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G. Yippee!",
