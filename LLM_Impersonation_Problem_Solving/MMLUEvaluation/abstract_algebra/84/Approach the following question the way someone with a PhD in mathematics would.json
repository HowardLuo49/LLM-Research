    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze each statement using our mathematical knowledge:\n\nStatement 1: The function g must necessarily be injective.\n\nTo prove this statement, we need to show that if g(x) = g(y), then x = y for all x, y in B. Since for all a in A, g(f(a)) = a, it implies that g is a left inverse of f. This means that g is injective by definition because if g(x) = g(y), then f(g(x)) = f(g(y)) which simplifies to x = y. Hence, statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nTo prove this statement, we need to show that for every element y in A, there exists an element x in B such that g(x) = y. Since g is a left inverse of f, it means that g is a surjection, as for any element a in A there exists an element x in B such that g(x) = a. Therefore, statement 2 is also True.\n\nCombining both statements, we conclude that the correct answer is A: True, True.",
