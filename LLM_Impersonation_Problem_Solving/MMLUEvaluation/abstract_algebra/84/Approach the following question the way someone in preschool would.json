    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we have a function f going from set A to set B, and a function g going from set B back to set A, then g(f(a)) = a means that when we apply function f and then function g, we get back to the original element a. So, for Statement 1, if g is not injective, that means g is not one-to-one and different elements in B could map to the same element in A, which would mean g(f(a)) could not necessarily equal a for all elements in A. Therefore, Statement 1 is False. Now, for Statement 2, if g is not surjective, that means there could be elements in A that are not mapped to by any element in B when going through the function g, which would mean g(f(a)) could not necessarily equal a for all elements in A. Therefore, Statement 2 is False as well. So, the answer is B: False, False.",
