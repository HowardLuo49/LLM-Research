    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. The first part is saying that g must be injective, which means that no two different elements in B can map to the same element in A. The second part is saying that g must be surjective, which means that every element in A is mapped to by at least one element in B. \n\nSo, let's think about it. If g is injective, then for each element in A, there can only be one element in B that maps to it. And since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, that means that every element in A is being uniquely mapped to in B by g. So yes, that means g must be injective. \n\nBut wait, does that mean g must be surjective too? Well, if g is injective and every element in A is being mapped to uniquely in B, then there can't be any element in B that isn't being used in the mapping. So g is also surjective. \n\nSo, based on my thinking, both statements are true. So, I would go with option A: True, True.",
