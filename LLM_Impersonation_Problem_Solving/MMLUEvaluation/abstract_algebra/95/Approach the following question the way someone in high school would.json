    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay let's break this down. So for the first statement, it's saying aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H. I think that makes sense because if a is not in H, then aH wouldn't be a subgroup of G. And for the second statement, it's saying aH equals bH if and only if ab is in H. I think that also makes sense because if ab is not in H, then aH wouldn't be equal to bH. So I would say the answer is A: True, True.",
