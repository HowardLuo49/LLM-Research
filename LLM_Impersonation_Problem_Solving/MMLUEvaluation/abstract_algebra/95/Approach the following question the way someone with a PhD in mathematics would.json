    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze both statements in a formal manner:\n\nStatement 1:\nIf H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then aH is a subgroup of G if and only if a is in H.\n\nProof:\nLet's assume aH is a subgroup of G. Then by definition of a subgroup, it must contain the identity element of G, which is e. Therefore, e = ah for some h in H. This implies that a = h where h is the inverse of a in H. Hence, a must be in H for aH to be a subgroup of G.\n\nConversely, if a is in H, then aH = H. Since H is a subgroup of G, aH is also a subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2:\nIf H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nProof:\nLet's assume aH = bH. Then, for any h in H, there exists an h' in H such that ah = bh'. This implies that a = bh'h^(-1). Since h' and h^(-1) are both in H and H is closed under multiplication, ab is in H.\n\nConversely, if ab is in H, then ah = b(ab^(-1)) is in bH for any h in H. Therefore, aH = bH.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is also true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
