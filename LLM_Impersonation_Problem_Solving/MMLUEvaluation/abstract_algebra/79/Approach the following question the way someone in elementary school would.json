    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if we have a group called K that is not nothing and is a part of a group that is made up of a bunch of pieces that can be added and subtracted (basically a bunch of numbers that can be added or subtracted), then K itself is also a group that can be made up of pieces that can be added or subtracted. So, Statement 1 is true because K is also a free abelian group. And for Statement 2, if you take the big group G and divide it by the group K, what you're left with is also a group that can be made up of pieces that can be added or subtracted. So, Statement 2 is also true. So, the answer is A: True, True.",
