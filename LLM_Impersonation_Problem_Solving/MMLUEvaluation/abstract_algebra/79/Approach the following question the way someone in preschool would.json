    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. If we have a group that is finitely generated and free abelian, and K is a nonzero subgroup of that group, then according to the first statement, K must also be free abelian. And if we look at the second statement, it says that if we have a nonzero subgroup K of a finitely generated free abelian group, then the quotient group G / K is also free abelian. So, both statements are saying that if we have a subgroup of a free abelian group, it will also be free abelian, and the quotient group will also be free abelian. I think both statements are true! So, I would choose answer choice A: True, True.",
