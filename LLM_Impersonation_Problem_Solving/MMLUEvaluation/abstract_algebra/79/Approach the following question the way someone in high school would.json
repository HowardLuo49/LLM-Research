So that statement is true.\n\nFor the second statement, if K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is also free abelian. Hmm, that makes sense because if K is already free abelian, then when you take the quotient group G / K, it should still be free abelian. So that statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: True, True.",
