    "gpt_response": "Um, okay so for statement 1, if H and K are subgroups of G, then the order of the subgroup generated by H and K is equal to the product of the orders of H and K divided by the order of their intersection. So that statement is true.\n\nAnd for statement 2, a group of order 2p where p is an odd prime can either be cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group of order p. So that statement is also true.\n\nSo the answer would be A: True, True.",
