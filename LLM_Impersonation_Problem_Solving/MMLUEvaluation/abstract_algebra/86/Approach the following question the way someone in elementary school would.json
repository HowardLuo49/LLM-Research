    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. For the first statement, it says that if we have two subgroups H and K of a group G, then the size of the combined group HK is equal to the product of the sizes of H and K divided by the size of their intersection. That sounds kind of tricky, but we can remember it by thinking about sharing toys - if you have two groups of friends and you want to know how many toys they have together, you can find out by multiplying how many toys each group has and then dividing by how many they both have. So, that statement is true!\n\nNow, for the second statement, it's talking about a group of a specific order, 2p where p is an odd prime. It says that group is either cyclic or isomorphic to something called D_p. We might not know what all those words mean, but we can still make a guess. If we have a group with only 2p members, it might not have enough elements to be cyclic, but it could be something else. Let's say this one is false.\n\nSo, the answers are True for the first statement and False for the second statement. That means the answer is C: True, False!",
