    "gpt_response": "To answer this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to analyze each statement carefully.\n\nStatement 1 is the formula for the number of elements in the product of two subgroups in a group. It is a well-known formula in group theory and is true. The formula states that the order of the subgroup generated by the product of two subgroups H and K is the product of the orders of H and K divided by the order of their intersection.\n\nStatement 2 states that a group of order 2p, where p is an odd prime, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group of order p. This statement is also true. This is a known result in group theory and specifically in the study of groups of small order. A group of order 2p must be either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group of order p, as these are the only two possibilities for groups of that order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
