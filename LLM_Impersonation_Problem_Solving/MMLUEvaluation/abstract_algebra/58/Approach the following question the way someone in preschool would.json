    "gpt_response": "Hmmm, groups of order 159 and groups of order 102, what are groups? Let's see, groups are like friends, they all like to do things together and they have special rules they follow. So, the first statement is saying all groups of order 159 are like one big friendship circle where they must do everything together in a certain order. The second statement is saying that groups of order 102 must have a special friend in the circle that stands out a little bit and follows different rules. So, my answer is True for the first statement and False for the second statement.",
