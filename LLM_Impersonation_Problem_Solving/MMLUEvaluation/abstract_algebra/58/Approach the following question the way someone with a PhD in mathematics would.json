    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to apply the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups.\n\nStatement 1 states that every group of order 159 is cyclic. The order of 159 can be factored as 3 * 53. According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, a group of order pq, where p and q are distinct prime numbers, is isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order pq or to a direct product of cyclic groups of orders p and q. Therefore, it is true that every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2 states that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. The order of 102 can be factored as 2 * 3 * 17. Again, applying the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, a group of order 2 * 3 * 17 can be isomorphic to either a cyclic group of order 102 or a direct product of cyclic groups of orders 2, 3, and 17. In both cases, there exist nontrivial proper normal subgroups. Therefore, it is also true that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
