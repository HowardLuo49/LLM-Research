    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay let's break this down. So for the first statement, it says that every group of order 159 is cyclic. I remember that cyclic means that the group can be generated by just one element. So if there is a group with 159 elements, and it can be generated by just one element, then that statement is true.\n\nNow for the second statement, it says that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. I know that a subgroup is a smaller group within a bigger group. And a normal subgroup is a special kind of subgroup that is closed under conjugation. A nontrivial subgroup means it's not just the whole group itself, and a proper subgroup means it's not the whole group either. So if every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, then that statement would also be true.\n\nSo both statements are true! So the answer is A: True, True.",
