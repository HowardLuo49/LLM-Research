Consider the group Z5 under addition where a = 1 and b = 4. Here, a is not equal to b, but a^2 = 1^2 = 1, and b^2 = 4^2 = 1. So, the statement does not hold true in all cases.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\nThis statement is true. In a dihedral group, the set of rotations forms a cyclic subgroup generated by a specific rotation. This is a fundamental property of dihedral groups and is true based on group theory knowledge.\n\nThus, the correct answer is: D: False, True.",
