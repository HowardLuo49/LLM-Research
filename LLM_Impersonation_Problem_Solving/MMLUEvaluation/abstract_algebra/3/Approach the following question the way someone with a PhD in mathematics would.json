    "gpt_response": "To approach this question from a mathematical perspective, we need to consider the definitions and properties of factor groups and normal subgroups. \n\nStatement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\nThis statement is true. A factor group is formed by taking a group and quotienting by one of its normal subgroups. If the original group is non-Abelian, then the presence of non-commutative elements in the group will carry over to the factor group, making it non-Abelian as well.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is also true. If K is normal in H, then for any g in G, the conjugate gKg^(-1) is a subgroup of H. Since H is normal in G, we have that gHg^(-1) = H for all g in G. Therefore, for any g in G, we have g(Kg^(-1))g^(-1) = K, which implies that K is normal in G.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
