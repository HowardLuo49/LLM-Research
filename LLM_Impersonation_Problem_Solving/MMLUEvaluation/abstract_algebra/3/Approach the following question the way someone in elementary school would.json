Statement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nA: True, True\nB: False, False\nC: True, False\nD: False, True",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay, let me think about this. So, the first statement says that if you have a group that is not Abelian, then any factor group of that group will also not be Abelian. The second statement is talking about normal subgroups and how if K is normal in H and H is normal in G, then K is normal in G. Well, normal subgroups means that the left and right cosets are the same, so if K is normal in H and H is normal in G, then K would also be normal in G. So, I think the answer is True for both statements. So, the answer is A: True, True.",
