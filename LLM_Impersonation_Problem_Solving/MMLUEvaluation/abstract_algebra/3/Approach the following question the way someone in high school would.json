    "gpt_response": "Umm, let's see. For the first statement, a factor group of a non-Abelian group is definitely non-Abelian because the factor group inherits the non-Abelian property from the original group. So, I think Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, for the second statement, I remember learning that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K may not necessarily be a normal subgroup of G. So, I would say that Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C: True, False.",
