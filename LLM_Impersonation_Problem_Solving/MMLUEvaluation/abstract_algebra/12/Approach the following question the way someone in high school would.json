    "gpt_response": "Ok, so in order to find the order of the factor group, we need to find the order of the subgroup generated by <1, 1> in Z_11 x Z_15. \n\nTo do this, we need to see how many elements in Z_11 x Z_15 are in the subgroup generated by <1, 1>. \n\nThe subgroup generated by <1, 1> contains all elements of the form (a, b) where a and b are integers modulo 11 and 15 respectively, and a + b = 0 mod 11 and 0 mod 15. \n\nWe can see that the only element in Z_11 x Z_15 that satisfies this condition is (0, 0). \n\nTherefore, the order of the factor group is 1, so the answer is A.",
