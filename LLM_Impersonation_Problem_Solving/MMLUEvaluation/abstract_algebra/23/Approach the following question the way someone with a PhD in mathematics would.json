    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the concept of nth roots of unity. The nth roots of unity are the complex numbers that, when raised to the power of n, equal 1. These numbers can be represented in polar form as e^(2*pi*i*k/n), where k is an integer ranging from 0 to n-1.\n\nUnder multiplication, the set of all nth roots of unity forms a group. A group is a set together with a binary operation (in this case, multiplication) that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses.\n\n1. Closure: The product of two nth roots of unity is also an nth root of unity, as the product of e^(2*pi*i*k1/n) and e^(2*pi*i*k2/n) is e^(2*pi*i*(k1+k2)/n), which is still an nth root of unity.\n\n2. Associativity: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, so the set of nth roots of unity under multiplication is associative.\n\n3. Identity element: The identity element for multiplication is 1, and the nth root of unity corresponding to k=0 is 1, making it the identity element for this group.\n\n4. Inverses: For every nth root of unity e^(2*pi*i*k/n), its multiplicative inverse is e^(-2*pi*i*k/n), which is also an nth root of unity.\n\nSince the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication satisfies these four properties, it forms a group. Additionally, since multiplication of complex numbers is commutative, this group is also an abelian group. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: abelian group",
