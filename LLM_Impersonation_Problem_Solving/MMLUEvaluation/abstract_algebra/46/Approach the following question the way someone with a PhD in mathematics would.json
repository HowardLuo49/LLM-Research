A homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group structure. The kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain group that map to the identity element in the codomain group. If a homomorphism has an empty kernel, it means that the function is injective (one-to-one).\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\nThis statement is false. It is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. For example, consider the group of integers under addition and the group of real numbers under addition. The function that maps each integer n to the real number n is a nontrivial homomorphism from the finite group of integers to the infinite group of real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: True, False",
