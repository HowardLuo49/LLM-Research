    "gpt_response": "Let's break this down. \n\nStatement 1 says that Q is an extension field of Z_2. This means that Q is a field that contains Z_2 as a subfield. Since Z_2 is the field with only 2 elements (0 and 1), Q must have more elements than just 0 and 1.\n\nStatement 2 says that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This means that if you have a polynomial with coefficients from a field, there will always be a way to find a root of that polynomial in some extension field.\n\nPutting these two statements together, we can see that Statement 1 is true because Q is an extension field of Z_2. Statement 2 is also true because it is a general property of fields and polynomials. Therefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
