    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see if the polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion! We need to find a prime number p that divides all the coefficients of the polynomial except the leading coefficient, and p^2 does not divide the constant term. Let's try p=2, 3, and 5.\n\nIf we let p=2, we see that 2 divides -12, but 2^2 does not divide -12. So, the Eisenstein criterion is satisfied with p=2.\n\nIf we let p=3, we see that 3 divides -12, but 3^2 does not divide -12. So, the Eisenstein criterion is satisfied with p=3.\n\nIf we let p=5, we see that 5 does not divide -12.
