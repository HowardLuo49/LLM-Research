    "gpt_response": "To find the zeros of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in the finite field Z_7, we need to substitute each element of Z_7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) into the polynomial and check whether the result is congruent to 0 modulo 7.\n\nLet's start by substituting 0 into the polynomial:\n0^3 + 2(0) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 (mod 7) which is not congruent to 0, so 0 is not a zero.\n\nNext, let's try substituting 1 into the polynomial:\n1^3 + 2(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 (mod 7) which is not congruent to 0, so 1 is not a zero.\n\nProceeding in the same manner, we find that substituting 2 or 3 into the polynomial also produces results that are not congruent to 0 modulo 7.\n\nNow, let's try substituting 4 into the polynomial:\n4^3 + 2(4) + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74 = 10 (mod 7) which is congruent to 3. \nSo, when we substitute 4, the result is congruent to 0 (mod 7), which means 4 is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the zeros of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 are 4. \nSo the correct answer is C: 4.",
