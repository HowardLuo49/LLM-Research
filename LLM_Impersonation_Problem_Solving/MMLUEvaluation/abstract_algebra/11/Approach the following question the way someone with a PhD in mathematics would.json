    "gpt_response": "To determine whether relation S is symmetric, anti-symmetric, or an equivalence relation, we must consider each of these properties individually.\n\nFirst, we check for symmetry. A relation is symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. In the case of relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, we see that for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is also in S. Thus, S is symmetric.\n\nNext, we check for anti-symmetry. A relation is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, if (a, b) and (b, a) are both in the relation, then a = b. In the case of relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, there are no pairs (a, b) and (b, a) in S where a \u2260 b. Thus, S is anti-symmetric.\n\nSince relation S is both symmetric and anti-symmetric, it is classified as both. Therefore, the correct answer is C: both symmetric and anti-symmetric.",
