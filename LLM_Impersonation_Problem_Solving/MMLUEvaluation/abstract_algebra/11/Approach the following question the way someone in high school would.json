In other words, if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation. \n\nA relation is anti-symmetric if for every (a, b) and (b, a) in the relation, a must equal b. In other words, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in the relation, then a must equal b. \n\nNow let's look at relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}. \n\nIn this relation, both (1, 1) and (2, 2) are present but there is no pair like (2, 1) so we can say this means it is not symmetric. \n\nAlso, in this relation, neither (1, 1) nor (2, 2) are relating to any other pair which would violate the anti-symmetric condition. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: anti-symmetric only.",
