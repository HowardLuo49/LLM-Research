    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze statement 1 first. \nThe degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. In the case of the sum of two polynomials, the degree of the sum is at most the maximum of the degrees of the two polynomials being added. \nHence, statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, let's move on to statement 2. \nAn ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements from the ring. In the case of a polynomial ring over a field, every ideal is generated by a single element, which means it is principal. This is a well-known property of polynomial rings over fields.\nHence, statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
