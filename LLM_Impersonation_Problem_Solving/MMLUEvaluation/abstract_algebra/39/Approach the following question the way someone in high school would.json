    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay so when I think about permutations, I know that they involve rearranging a set of elements. And cycles, well they involve moving elements around in a specific order. So if every permutation is a cycle, that means a permutation must be moving elements around in a specific order. And if every cycle is a permutation, that means a cycle must involve rearranging elements. So I think both statements are actually true. So I would go with option A: True, True.",
