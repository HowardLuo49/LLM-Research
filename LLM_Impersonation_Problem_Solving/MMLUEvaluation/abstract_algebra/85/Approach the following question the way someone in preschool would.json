That sounds kinda tricky, but I think it means that each element in the group is being sent to a different element in the other group. So, I think that might be true. And for statement 2, it's saying the image of a group with 6 elements could have 4 elements under a homomorphism. I'm not sure about that one, it seems kinda confusing. So maybe that one is false. So, maybe the answer is True, False?",
