That means the homomorphism doesn't map any other element to the identity except for the identity itself. So true for the first statement.\n\nFor the second statement, it says the image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements. This means that the homomorphism can map the 6 elements in the group to just 4 elements in the image. So also true for the second statement.\n\nSo both statements are true.
