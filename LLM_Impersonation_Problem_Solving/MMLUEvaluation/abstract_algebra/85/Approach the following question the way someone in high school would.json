Statement 1 | A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, I remember learning about homomorphisms in math class. So, for the first statement, if a homomorphism is one to one, that means each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain. And I think the kernel is the set of elements that map to the identity element. So, if the kernel consists of only the identity element, that would mean the homomorphism is one to one. So, I think Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow for the second statement. If we have a group with 6 elements, it could be anything, like integers mod 6 or something. And if we have a homomorphism from that group to another group, the image is the set of elements in the codomain that actually get mapped to from the elements in the domain. So, I guess it's possible for the image to have 4 elements if some elements from the domain map to the same element in the codomain. So, I think Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, my final answer is A: True, True.",
