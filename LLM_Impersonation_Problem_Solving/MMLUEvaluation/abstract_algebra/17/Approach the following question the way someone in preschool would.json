    "gpt_response": "Well, to find the product (2,3)(3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9, we need to multiply the first elements together and the second elements together. So, 2 times 3 is 6, but since we are working in Z_5 we take the remainder when dividing by 5, which is 1. Then, 3 times 5 is 15, but since we are working in Z_9 we take the remainder when dividing by 9, which is 6. Therefore, the answer is (1,6), which is choice C.",
