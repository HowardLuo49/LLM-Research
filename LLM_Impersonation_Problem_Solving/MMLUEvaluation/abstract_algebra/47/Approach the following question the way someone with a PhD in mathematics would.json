    "gpt_response": "To determine which values of c in the field Z_3 make Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) a field, we need to check if x^3 + x^2 + c is irreducible over Z_3. \n\nFirst, note that any polynomial of degree 2 or less in Z_3[x] is automatically irreducible if it does not have a root in Z_3. So, if c = 0, x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2, and this polynomial does not have a root in Z_3 since f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, and f(2) = 1.\n\nTherefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2) will be a field. \n\nIf c is any non-zero element in Z_3, assume c = 1, 2, or 3, then x^3 + x^2 + c would have either 0, 1, or 2 as a root respectively. For example, if c = 1, then f(0) = 1, f(1) = 3 = 0 in Z_3, and f(2) = 7 = 1 in Z_3. Thus, since f(1) = 0, x - 1 would be a divisor of x^3 + x^2 + 1, making it reducible. \n\nHence, the only value of c that makes Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) a field is c = 0, so the answer is (A) 0.",
