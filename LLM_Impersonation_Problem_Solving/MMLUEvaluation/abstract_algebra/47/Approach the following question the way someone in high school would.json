    "gpt_response": "To find all the values of c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field, we need to determine if the polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c is irreducible over Z_3.\n\nLet's try each value of c in Z_3 (0, 1, 2) and see if the polynomial is irreducible:\n\nFor c = 0: The polynomial becomes x^3 + x^2, which can be factored as x^2(x + 1). Since it is not irreducible, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2) is not a field.\n\nFor c = 1: The polynomial becomes x^3 + x^2 + 1.
