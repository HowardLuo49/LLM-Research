    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have this group that is called Z and the operation is *. To find the inverse of a number a, we need to find another number that, when we do the operation *, we get the identity element which is 0. So let's say we have the number a, the inverse would be the number b that makes a*b = 0. In this case, the equation is a+b+1 = 0. So to find the inverse of a, we need to solve for b which gives us b = -1-a. Therefore, the answer is D: (2+a)*-1.",
