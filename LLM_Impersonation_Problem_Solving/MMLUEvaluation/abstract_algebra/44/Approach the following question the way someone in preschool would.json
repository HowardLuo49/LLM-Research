If we have a set A and a set B, and we have a function f that maps elements from A to B, then if g goes from B back to A and g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, that means f must be a \"one-to-one\" function, where every element in A goes to a unique element in B. So, I think Statement 1 is true because f must be injective, which means it's one-to-one. But I'm not sure about Statement 2. Maybe f doesn't have to cover all of B, so it might not be surjective. So, I think Statement 2 is false. So my answer is C: True, False.",
