    "gpt_response": "To prove the statements, we will use the definitions and properties of vectors in R^2 and span in linear algebra.\n\nStatement 1: Any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent.\nProof: Let the two vectors be v1 = (x1, y1) and v2 = (x2, y2). We need to show that the only solution to c1v1 + c2v2 = 0 is c1 = c2 = 0. This gives us the following system of equations:\nc1x1 + c2x2 = 0\nc1y1 + c2y2 = 0\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero (x1y2 - x2y1 != 0), the only solution is c1 = c2 = 0. Therefore, any set of two vectors in R^2 is linearly independent.\n\nStatement 2: If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\nProof: Since {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, we can express any vector in V as a linear combination of the vectors v1, v2, ..., vk. Therefore, dim(V) = k.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
