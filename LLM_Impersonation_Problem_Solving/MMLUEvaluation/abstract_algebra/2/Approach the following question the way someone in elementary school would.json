    "gpt_response": "To find the zeros in the field of 5, we need to substitute each number from 0 to 4 into the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x and see if the result is 0.\n\nWhen we substitute 0 into the polynomial, we get 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + (0)^2 + 2(0) = 0. So, 0 is a zero.\n\nWhen we substitute 1 into the polynomial, we get 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + (1)^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 4. So, 1 is not a zero.\n\nWhen we substitute 2 into the polynomial, we get 2^5 + 3(2)^3 + (2)^2 + 2(2) = 32 + 24 + 4 + 4 = 64, which is equivalent to 4 in the field of 5. So, 2 is not a zero.\n\nWhen we substitute 3 into the polynomial, we get 3^5 + 3(3)^3 + (3)^2 + 2(3) = 243 + 81 + 9 + 6 = 339, which is equivalent to 4 in the field of 5. So, 3 is not a zero.\n\nWhen we substitute 4 into the polynomial, we get 4^5 + 3(4)^3 + (4)^2 + 2(4) = 1024 + 192 + 16 + 8 = 1240, which is equivalent to 0 in the field of 5. So, 4 is also a zero.\n\nTherefore, the zeros of the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x in the field of 5 are 0 and 4. \nThe answer is D: 0,4.",
