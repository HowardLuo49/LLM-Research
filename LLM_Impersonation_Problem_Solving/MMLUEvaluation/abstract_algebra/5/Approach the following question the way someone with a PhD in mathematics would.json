The order of an element refers to the smallest positive integer n such that g^n = e, where e is the identity element. Therefore, if an element has order 15 in a group, it generates a subgroup of order 15, not necessarily consisting of 8 elements.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\nThis statement is true. If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it means that there are two distinct elements, say a and b, that have order 15. The subgroup generated by a and b has at least 16 elements (as it contains a, b, a^2, a^3, ..., a^14 and b, ba, ba^2, ba^3, ..., ba^14). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
