    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to analyze the statements using our knowledge of group theory and understand the definitions of the terms used.\n\nStatement 1 states that for finite groups G and H, the order of their internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of the orders of G and H. This is a fundamental property of the internal direct product of groups and can be proven using the definition of the internal direct product. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2 states that if r divides m and s divides n, then the group Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. This is also a well-known result in group theory, specifically in the context of cyclic groups and their subgroups. By using the division property, we can show that Z_m + Z_n can be decomposed into subgroups isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.
