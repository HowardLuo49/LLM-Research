    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to analyze the properties of finite groups and subgroups, as well as the concept of order of an element in a group.\n\nStatement 1 is a well-known result in group theory, known as Lagrange's theorem. It states that for a finite group G with order n, if d is a positive divisor of n, then there exists a subgroup of G with order d. This theorem is fundamental in the study of finite groups.\n\nStatement 2 is also true, and it is related to the order of elements in a group. The order of an element a in a group G, denoted by |a|, is the smallest positive integer k such that a^k = e, where e is the identity element of G. The order of an element always divides the order of the group. This is a basic property of groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True.",
