    "gpt_response": "Hmm, I remember learning about subgroups and orders in my group theory class in high school. So for the first statement, if a group has order n, then it must contain a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor of n. That sounds right to me, so I'll go with True for the first statement. And for the second statement, if an element a belongs to a finite group, then the order of a must divide the order of the group G. That also makes sense from what I remember, so I'll go with True for the second statement. So my final answer is A: True, True.",
