    "gpt_response": "First, let us analyze Statement 1. A splitting field of a polynomial over a field is a field extension containing all the roots of the polynomial. In this case, R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q, which means that R is a field extension of Q containing all the roots of the polynomial. This statement is true.\n\nNext, let us consider Statement 2. There is a well-known theorem in algebraic number theory that states that for any prime power p^n, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) finite field with p^n elements. In this case, 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5, which means that there exists a unique field with 60 elements, denoted as GF(60) or F60. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
