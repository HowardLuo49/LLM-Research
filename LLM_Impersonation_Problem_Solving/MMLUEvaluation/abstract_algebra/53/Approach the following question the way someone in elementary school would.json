That makes sense because if they all had different structures, we would have too many ways to arrange them. So, that statement is true.\n\nThe second statement says if two groups are isomorphic, then certain numbers have to divide each other. That seems like it could be true because if they are the same, then their sizes must be related in some way. So, that statement is also true.\n\nSo, my answer is A: True, True.",
