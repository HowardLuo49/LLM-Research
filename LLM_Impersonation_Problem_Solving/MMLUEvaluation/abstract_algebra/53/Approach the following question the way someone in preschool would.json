    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If we have groups of order 4, that means they have 4 elements each. And if we have 3 groups, then at least 2 of them are the same. So that means the first statement is true! Now for the second statement, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. Hmm, let's think about this... Oh, I remember! If two groups are isomorphic, then their orders must divide each other. So that means the second statement is also true! So the answer is A: True, True. Yay, we got it right!",
