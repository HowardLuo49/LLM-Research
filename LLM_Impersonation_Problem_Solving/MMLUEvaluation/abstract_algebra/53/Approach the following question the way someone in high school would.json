    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so for the first statement, if G, H, and K are groups of order 4, that means they could be cyclic groups or maybe even Klein 4-groups. Since there are only two groups of order 4 up to isomorphism, at least two of them must be isomorphic. So that statement is true. \n\nAs for the second statement, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then that means the orders of the two groups are the same. So r + s = m + n. That also means that r divides m and s divides n, because r is a factor of m and s is a factor of n. So statement 2 is also true. \n\nSo my answer would be A: True, True.",
