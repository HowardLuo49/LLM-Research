    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of these polynomials, we just need to add them together! First, let's add the like terms: 4x + 2x^2 - 5 - 4x + 2. \nThis simplifies to 2x^2 + 6x - 3. \nNow, since we're working in Z_8[x], we need to reduce the coefficients modulo 8. In this case, -3 is the same as 5 (because -3 + 8 = 5). \nTherefore, the sum of f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x] is 2x^2 + 6x + 5, which simplifies to 2x^2 + 6x + 5 modulo 8. \nSo, the answer is B: 6x^2 + 4x + 6.",
