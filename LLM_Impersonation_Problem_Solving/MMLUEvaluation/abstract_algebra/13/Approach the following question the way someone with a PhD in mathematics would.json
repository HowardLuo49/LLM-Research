By checking each value of x from 0 to 6, we see that x = 3 is a root since (3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 0.\nSince x = 3 is a root of the polynomial, we can factor out (x - 3) from x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1. Using polynomial division or synthetic division, we find that x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 3)(x^2 + 5x + 3).\nWe can further factor x^2 + 5x + 3 by quadratic formula or completing the square to obtain x^2 + 5x + 3 = (x + 1)(x + 4).\nThus, the factorization of the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 in Z_7[x] is (x - 3)(x + 1)(x + 4), which corresponds to option B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x \u2212 3).",
