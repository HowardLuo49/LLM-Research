Let's try different combinations of our blocks to see which one fits. If we try option A: (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1), we can see that it doesn't match the polynomial we have. Let's try option B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2) next. Oh no, that one doesn't match either. Let's try option C: (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2). Hmm, this one doesn't fit either. Let's try option D: (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2). Yay, this one fits! So, the correct answer is D: (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2). Great job, friends!",
