    "gpt_response": "To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we first need to understand the structure of the factor group 2Z/4Z. The cosets of 4Z in 2Z are the sets of the form a + 4Z, where a is an element of 2Z. \n\nSince 2Z consists of even integers and 4Z consists of multiples of 4, we can write 2Z as {0, 2, -2, 4, -4, ...} and 4Z as {..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...}.\n\nNow, we calculate the cosets:\n0 + 4Z = {0, 4, -4, 8, -8, ...} = 4Z\n2 + 4Z = {2, 6, -2, 10, -6, ...} = 2 + 4Z\n\nTherefore, the set of cosets of 4Z in 2Z is {4Z, 2 + 4Z}. \n\nThe correct answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.",
