So, the cosets of 4Z of 2Z are like groups of candies that we can make by adding some candy from 2Z to the candies already in 4Z. \n\nSo, the cosets of 4Z of 2Z are:\nA: 4Z (just the candies that are multiples of 4)\nB: 4Z, 2 + 4Z (candies that are multiples of 4 and some candies that are 2 more than multiples of 4)\nC: 2Z (just the candies that are multiples of 2)\nD: Z (just all the candies)\n\nSo, the answer is B: 4Z, 2 + 4Z.",
