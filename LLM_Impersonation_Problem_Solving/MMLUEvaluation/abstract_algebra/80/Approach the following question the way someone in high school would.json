    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. Statement 1 says that when you take the external direct product of cyclic groups, the result is also cyclic. That sounds right because when you combine two cyclic groups, the resulting group is still cyclic. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, Statement 2 says that the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12. Well, D_3 and D_4 are both dihedral groups, so it makes sense that their external direct product would be isomorphic to D_12. So, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option A: True, True.",
