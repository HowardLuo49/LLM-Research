And for the second one, if you mix different groups together, they might not be the same as one of the original groups. So, for the first statement it sounds like it would be true that the big group is still cyclic. And for the second statement, it sounds like it would be false because the big group might not be isomorphic to one of the original groups. So, I think the answer is C: True, False.",
