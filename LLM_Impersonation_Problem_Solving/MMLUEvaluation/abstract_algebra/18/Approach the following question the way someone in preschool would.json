A group is a special math club where the operation is like a game and has special rules. So let's look at the options. A - multiplication is a game where you multiply two numbers together so it is a binary operation. B - associative means that you can do the operations in any order and get the same answer, so maybe that's the problem. C - identity element sounds like a special super hero, but maybe that's missing from our real numbers. D - inverse means each number has a special friend that when you multiply them together gives you one, but zero doesn't have a special friend. So maybe the answer is D, zero has no inverse!",
