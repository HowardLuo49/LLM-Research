Statement 2 | If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\nA: True, True\nB: False, False\nC: True, False\nD: False, True",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break it down. \n\nFor Statement 1, if there is an element of order 10 in a group, it means that there are elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 as well. This is because the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element. So if an element has an order of 10, it must also have orders 1, 2, and 5. \n\nFor Statement 2, if there are elements of orders 2 and 3 in a group, then the group must also have an element of order 6. This is because the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e. So if there are elements of orders 2 and 3, their least common multiple is 6, which means there must be an element of order 6 in the group as well. \n\nSo, the answer is A: True, True.",
