So if there is a group with an element of order 10, it must also have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. That sounds true to me.\n\nSecond statement says that if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6. If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it must have an element of order 6 as well. That also sounds true to me.\n\nSo both statements sound true to me.
