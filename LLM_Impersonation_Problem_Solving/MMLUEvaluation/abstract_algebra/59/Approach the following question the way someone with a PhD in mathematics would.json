    "gpt_response": "To adequately address these statements, one must have a deep understanding of group theory, specifically the concepts of subgroups, normal subgroups, and Abelian groups. \n\nIn Statement 1, we are considering the product of two subgroups H and K in a group G. If either H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then the product HK is indeed a subgroup of G. This can be proven by showing that the product of any two elements in HK is also in HK, as well as the inverse of any element in HK. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nIn Statement 2, we are considering groups of order p^2 where p is a prime number. A group of order p^2 must have either order p or order p^2. When the order is p, the group is cyclic and therefore Abelian. When the order is p^2, the group is isomorphic to either Zp x Zp or Zp^2, both of which are Abelian. Thus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: True, True.",
