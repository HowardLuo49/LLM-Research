    "gpt_response": "The first statement says that if you have two subgroups H and K in a group G, and one of them is normal, then when you combine them together, HK will also be a subgroup. The second statement says that all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian, which means that their elements commute with each other.\n\nSo let's break it down. If we have two groups H and K and one is normal in the bigger group G, then HK will also be a subgroup. That sounds true because if one group is normal, it means that its left and right cosets are the same, so when you combine them, you still get a group.\n\nFor the second statement, it says all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian. If we think of a small group like this with just a few elements, we can see that it's easier for the elements to commute with each other because there aren't as many possibilities for them to interact. So maybe this one is also true.\n\nSo I think the answer is A: True, True. Both statements sound like they could be correct based on what we've learned.",
