This can be proven using the fact that the product of two transpositions in S_n can result in different permutations depending on the order in which they are multiplied.\n\nStatement 2 is false because the order of the product of two permutations is not necessarily equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual permutations. This is because the concept of order in group theory is not interchangeable with the concept of order in arithmetic. In general, the order of a product of permutations in a non-Abelian group can be quite different from the lcm of the orders of the individual permutations.",
