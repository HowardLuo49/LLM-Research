    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. For the first statement, an integral domain with characteristic 0 means that there are no non-zero elements that add up to 0. So if it's finite, that wouldn't really make sense because you could keep adding elements together and never get 0. So Statement 1 is probably True. \n\nNow for the second statement, an integral domain with prime characteristic means that the characteristic is a prime number. If it's finite, that means there's only a certain number of elements in the domain, which makes sense because if the characteristic is a prime number, you can't keep adding elements together and never get 0. So Statement 2 is also probably True.\n\nSo I think the answer is A: True, True.",
