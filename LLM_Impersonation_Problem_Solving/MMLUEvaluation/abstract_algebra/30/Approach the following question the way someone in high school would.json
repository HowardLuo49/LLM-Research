    "gpt_response": "Hmm, I remember learning about subgroups and normal subgroups in my high school math class. So statement 1 is saying that if H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then aH is the same as Ha. And statement 2 is saying that if H is a normal subgroup of G, then ah is equal to ha for all h in H. I think statement 1 is true because in a group, left cosets are the same as right cosets. And statement 2 is also true because in a normal subgroup, the left and right cosets are the same. So, I would say the answer is A: True, True.",
