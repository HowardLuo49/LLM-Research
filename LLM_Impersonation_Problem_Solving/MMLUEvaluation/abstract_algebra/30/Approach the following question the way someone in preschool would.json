    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 says that if we have a group G and a subgroup H, and we pick an element a from G, then aH is the same as Ha. This means that if we multiply a by any element from H, it's the same as multiplying that element from H by a. This is like when we mix colors together, it doesn't matter what order we mix them in, we still get the same result!\n\nStatement 2 says that if we have a normal subgroup H of group G, and we pick an element a from G, then when we multiply a by any element h from H, it's the same as multiplying h by a. This means that the order we multiply them in doesn't matter, just like in statement 1.\n\nSo, both statements are talking about the same idea, just using different words.
