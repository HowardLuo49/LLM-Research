    "gpt_response": "I think the first statement is true because a group is a set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for all elements. The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant satisfies these conditions.\n\nI'm not sure about the second statement though. I know that the set of 2 x 2 matrices with determinant 1 is called the special linear group, but I'm not sure if it forms a group under matrix multiplication. So I would say Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. So my answer would be C: True, False.",
