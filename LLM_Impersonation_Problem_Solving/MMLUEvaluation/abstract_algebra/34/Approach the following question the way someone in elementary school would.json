    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 says that if T is a linear transformation from V to W and dim(V) is less than dim(W) and dim(W) is less than 1, then T must be injective. I think this is true because if dim(V) is less than dim(W), that means there are more vectors in W than in V. And if dim(W) is less than 1, that means W is a one-dimensional space. So if T is mapping V to W and there are more vectors in W than in V, then T must be injective. So Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2 says that if the dimension of V is n and T is a linear transformation from V to V and T is injective, then T is a bijection. I think this is false because just because T is injective doesn't mean it is surjective. So Statement 2 is False.\n\nSo the answer is: C) True, False.",
