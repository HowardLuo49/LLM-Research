    "gpt_response": "So, in high school terms, Statement 1 is basically saying that if you have a linear transformation from a vector space V to another vector space W, and the dimension of V is smaller than the dimension of W, then the transformation must be injective (meaning each element in V only maps to one element in W). \n\nStatement 2 is saying that if you have a linear transformation from a vector space V to itself, and the transformation is injective (each element in V only maps to one element in V), then it must also be a bijection (meaning each element in V maps to a unique element in V).\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Statement 1: If the dimension of V is smaller than the dimension of W, then the linear transformation T must be injective. This makes sense because if there are fewer dimensions in V than in W, then each element in V would map to a unique element in W. So, Statement 1 is True.\n\n- Statement 2: If a linear transformation from a vector space to itself is injective, then it is a bijection. This also makes sense because if each element in V only maps to one element in V, then it is both injective and surjective, making it a bijection. So, Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A: True, True.",
