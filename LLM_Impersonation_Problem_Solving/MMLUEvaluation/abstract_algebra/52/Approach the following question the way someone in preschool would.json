    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see! We have to find which number you can multiply by any other number in the group and still get the same number. Let's try multiplying each number by the other numbers in the group to find the one that does that. Let's start with 2: \n\n2 x 2 = 4\n2 x 4 = 8\n2 x 6 = 2\n2 x 8 = 6\n\nHmm, it looks like 2 does not work as the identity element. Let's try 4 now:\n\n4 x 2 = 8\n4 x 4 = 6\n4 x 6 = 2\n4 x 8 = 4\n\nHmm, it looks like 4 is also not the identity element. Let's try 6 now:\n\n6 x 2 = 2\n6 x 4 = 8\n6 x 6 = 6\n6 x 8 = 4\n\nYay! It looks like 6 is the identity element in this group G under multiplication modulo 10. So the answer is A: 6. Great job everyone!",
