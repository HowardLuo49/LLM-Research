    "gpt_response": "We will analyze each statement individually:\n\nStatement 1:\nEvery group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian.\n\nProof:\nLet G be a group of order p^2, where p is prime. By the Sylow theorems, G must have at least one Sylow p-subgroup, say P. Since the order of P is a power of p, it must be of order p or p^2. If P is of order p^2, then P is the whole group G and G is Abelian. If P is of order p, then by a result in group theory, P must be normal in G. In any case, G is Abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2:\nFor a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nProof:\nLet G be a group with a unique Sylow p-subgroup P. If P is normal in G, then P is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G by the Sylow theorems. Conversely, if P is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G, then P is normal in G. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: True, True.",
