    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we must first understand the definitions of a cyclic group and an Abelian group.\n\nA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element, meaning all elements of the group are powers of a fixed element. An Abelian group, also known as a commutative group, is a group in which the order of the elements does not affect the outcome of the group operation.\n\nStatement 1: The homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\nThis statement is true. Let G be a cyclic group generated by an element g. Let \u03c6 be a homomorphism from G to a group H. Then the image of \u03c6 is {\u03c6(g), \u03c6(g^2), \u03c6(g^3), ... }. Since \u03c6 is a homomorphism, the image will be generated by \u03c6(g), which means the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is again cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\nThis statement is also true. Let G be an Abelian group and \u03c6 be a homomorphism from G to a group H. Then for any two elements a, b in G, \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(ba) = \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a). Since the group operation in H also commutes, the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is also an Abelian group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: True, True.",
