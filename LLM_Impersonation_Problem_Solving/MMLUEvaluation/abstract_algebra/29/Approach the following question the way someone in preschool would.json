If you take a picture of the group, that's like the homomorphic image. So if the friends are in a line in the picture, the picture is also cyclic. That means Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow let's think about Statement 2. If the friends in the group play nicely and share all their toys, that group is called Abelian. So if you take a picture of that group, the picture would also be Abelian. So Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo the answer is A: True, True.",
