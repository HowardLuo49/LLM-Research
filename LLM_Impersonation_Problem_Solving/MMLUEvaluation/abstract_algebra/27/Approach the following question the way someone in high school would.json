    "gpt_response": "Ok, so to determine whether this polynomial satisfies an Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q, we need to find a prime number p such that p divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient, but p squared does not divide the constant coefficient. Looking at the polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24, we see that p=3 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (which is 8), and p squared (which is 9) does not divide the constant coefficient (which is 24).
