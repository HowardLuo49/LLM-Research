    "gpt_response": "Well, Eisenstein criterion says that if there exists a prime number p such that p divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient, and p squared does not divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible over Q. \n\nFor this polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24, the coefficients are 8, 6, -9, and 24. We can see that 2 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (8), and 2 squared (4) does not divide the constant term (24). So, the polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for p=2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A: Yes, with p=2.",
