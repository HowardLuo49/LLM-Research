    "gpt_response": "To determine the correct answer, we need to first understand the properties of homomorphisms in group theory. \n\nStatement 1 is true because the image of a group under a homomorphism is a subgroup of the codomain group, and the size of the image divides the size of the group. Since 6 divides 12, it is possible for the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism to have 12 elements. \n\nStatement 2 is also true because there exists a homomorphism from the cyclic group of order 6 (e.g. integers modulo 6 under addition) to the cyclic group of order 12 (e.g. integers modulo 12 under addition). This homomorphism can map each element of the group of 6 elements to its double in the group of 12 elements, resulting in a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
