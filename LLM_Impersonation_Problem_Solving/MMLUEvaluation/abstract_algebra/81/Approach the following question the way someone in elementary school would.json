That sounds right, because if a group has more than one element, you can always find different combinations to make a base. And the second statement says that any group with at least 2 things in it will also have lots of bases. That makes sense too, because you can always find different ways to make a base with more than one element. So I think both statements are true, so the answer is A: True, True!",
