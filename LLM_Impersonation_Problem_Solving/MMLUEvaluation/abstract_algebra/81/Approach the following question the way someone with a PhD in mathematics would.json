Statement 1 is true because any nonzero free abelian group can be generated by a basis, which can have infinitely many elements. Statement 2 is also true because a free abelian group of rank at least 2 implies that it has at least 2 generators, which means there are infinitely many ways to choose a basis from these generators.",
