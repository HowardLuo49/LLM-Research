    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 is true. To show that the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n, we must show that it satisfies the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and invertibility.\n\nClosure: Multiplying any two elements in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} modulo n will result in another element in the same set. This is because multiplying two integers in the set and taking the result modulo n will still keep the result within the set.\n\nAssociativity: Multiplication is associative, so the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} under multiplication modulo n is also associative.\n\nIdentity element: The number 1 acts as the identity element for multiplication modulo n. For any number k in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}, we have 1 * k = k * 1 = k (mod n).\n\nInvertibility: For any element k in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1}, the multiplicative inverse can be found using the Euclidean algorithm and the fact that gcd(k, n) = 1. \n\nStatement 2 is also true. To show the existence of an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. By finding the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100, we can find the integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.",
