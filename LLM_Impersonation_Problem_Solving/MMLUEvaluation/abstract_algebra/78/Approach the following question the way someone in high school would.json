    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break it down. \n\nFor statement 1, it's talking about a set being a group under multiplication modulo n. I remember learning about modular arithmetic in math class, so I know that {1,2, ..., n-1} would form a group under multiplication modulo n if n is a prime number. Since we're given that n > 1, we know it's not a prime number, so statement 1 is false.\n\nFor statement 2, it's saying there is some integer x that makes 63x mod 100 equal to 1. I know that this is true because 63 and 100 are coprime (they don't share any factors other than 1). So, statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together, statement 1 is false and statement 2 is true. So, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
