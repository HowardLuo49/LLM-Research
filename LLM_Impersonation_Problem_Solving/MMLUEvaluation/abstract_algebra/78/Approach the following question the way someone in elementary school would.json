    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break it down. The first statement is saying that if we have a number n that is greater than 1, then the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group when we multiply them and do the operation modulo n. This statement sounds a bit complicated but it's basically saying that if we have a bunch of numbers and multiply them together but only keep the remainder when dividing by n, then we still get a group. That means statement 1 is True.\n\nNow, let's move on to statement 2. This statement is saying that there is an integer x such that when we multiply it by 63 and then take the remainder when dividing by 100, we get 1. This might be a bit trickier to understand but it's basically asking if there is a number we can multiply by 63 to get 1 when we do the operation modulo 100. This is also True.\n\nSo, the answer is A: True, True.",
