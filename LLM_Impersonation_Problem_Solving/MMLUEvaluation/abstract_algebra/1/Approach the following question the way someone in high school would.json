Continuing this pattern, we find that p^4 = (1, 4, 5, 2, 3) and p^5 = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) = p. \n\nSo the subgroup generated by p, <p>, is {p, p^2, p^3, p^4, p^5}. This subgroup contains 5 elements. \n\nSince S_5 (the symmetric group on 5 elements) contains 5! = 120 elements, the index of <p> in S_5 is 120/5 = 24. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 24.",
