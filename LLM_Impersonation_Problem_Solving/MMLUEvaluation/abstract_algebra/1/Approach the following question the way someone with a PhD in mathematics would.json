    "gpt_response": "To find the index of the subgroup generated by p in S_5, we first need to determine the order of p. \n\nThe order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. Since p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), the disjoint cycles are (1, 2, 5, 4) and (2, 3). The lengths of these cycles are 4 and 2, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the order of p is LCM(4, 2) = 4. \n\nNext, we know that the index of a subgroup H in a group G is given by [G:H] = |G| / |H|, where |G| is the order of the group G and |H| is the order of the subgroup H.\n\nSince |S_5| = 5!, we have |S_5| = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. \n\nThe order of <p> is the order of p, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is 120 / 4 = 30.\n\nHowever, since p is an element of S_5, we need to consider the stabilizer subgroup of p before calculating the index.\n\nThe stabilizer subgroup of p is the set of all elements of S_5 that fix the elements of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} under the action of p.
