    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as a mathematician with a PhD in mathematics, we need to carefully analyze each statement based on the definitions and properties of abelian groups.\n\nStatement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion free.\nThis statement is true. A free abelian group is defined as a group that can be generated by a set of elements without any relations among them, meaning that every element can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination of the generator elements. Torsion refers to elements in a group that have a finite order. In a free abelian group, there are no elements of finite order since the elements are linearly independent. Therefore, every free abelian group is indeed torsion free.\n\nStatement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\nThis statement is false. While it is true that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is torsion-free, it is not necessarily free. There exist torsion-free abelian groups that are not free, such as the Pr\u00fcfer group. This group is torsion-free but not free, as it has elements with infinite order that cannot be expressed as linear combinations of a set of generators.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: True, False",
