    "gpt_response": "Um, I'm not totally sure but I think Statement 1 is true because torsion is like when you multiply a group element by a certain number and get the identity element. And since abelian groups are commutative, the only number that when multiplied gives the identity is 0. So if a group is free (which means it's generated by independent elements), then it must be torsion free too. \n\nAnd for Statement 2, I think it's false because not all torsion-free abelian groups are finitely generated. So yeah, I think the answer is probably C: True, False.",
