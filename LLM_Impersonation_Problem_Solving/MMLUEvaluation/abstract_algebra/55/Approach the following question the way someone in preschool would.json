    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. A free abelian group is a group with a basis where all elements can be written as a unique linear combination of the basis elements. Torsion free means that there are no non-zero elements that have a specific finite order. So, if a group is free, then it is automatically torsion free because none of the elements have a finite order restriction. \n\nAs for the second statement, if a group is finitely generated and torsion free, then it is a free abelian group. This is because being finitely generated means that there is a finite set of elements that can generate the entire group, and being torsion free means that none of these elements have finite orders restricting them. So, if all the elements are free to move around without any restrictions, then the group is free abelian.\n\nSo, the first statement is True and the second statement is True. So, the answer is A: True, True.",
