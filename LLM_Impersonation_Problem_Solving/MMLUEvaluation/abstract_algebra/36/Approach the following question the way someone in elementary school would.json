    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to multiply 20 by -8 in the ring Z_26. \n\nFirst, we multiply 20 x -8 which gives us -160. \n\nNext, we need to find the remainder when -160 is divided by 26. This will give us the answer in the ring Z_26. \n\n-160 divided by 26 gives us a remainder of -8. \n\nSince we are working in the ring Z_26, we take the remainder to be positive, so the answer is 18. \n\nTherefore, the product of (20)(-8) in Z_26 is 18. \n\nThe correct answer is not listed here, but based on our elementary school calculations it would be 18.",
