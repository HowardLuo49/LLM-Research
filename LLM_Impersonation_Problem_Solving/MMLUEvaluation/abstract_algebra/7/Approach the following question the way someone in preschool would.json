And if it's one to one, that means each little circle goes to a different part of the big circle. So yeah, the kernel would be {0} because that's like the middle part of the big circle where everything squishes together.\n\nAnd for the second one, Q is like the letter after P and R is like the letter after Q. So maybe Q could be an ideal in R because it's all nice and organized, like how the letters go in order. So maybe True for that one too.\n\nSo I think the answer is True, True!",
