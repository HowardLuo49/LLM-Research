Which of the following statements is true?\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question methodically, we must examine each statement individually:\n\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nExplanation: An equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A partial-ordering relation is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. While equivalence relations and partial-ordering relations share the transitive property, they differ in terms of symmetry and antisymmetry. Therefore, Statement A is false.\n\nB: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2), is 64.\nExplanation: The number of relations from a set A containing m elements to a set B containing n elements is equal to 2^(mn). In this case, m = 3 and n = 2, so the number of relations would be 2^(3*2) = 2^6 = 64. Therefore, Statement B is true.\n\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nExplanation: An empty relation is a relation that contains no ordered pairs. A relation is reflexive if for every element a in the set A, it satisfies the property (a, a) is in the relation. Since there are no ordered pairs in the empty relation, it cannot fulfill the reflexive property for any element. Therefore, Statement C is false.\n\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\nExplanation: This statement is not entirely clear as there is no standard mathematical definition for an \"un-symmetric\" relation. Symmetric relations are such that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is also in the relation. In general terms, un-symmetric could be interpreted as not symmetric, meaning that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) may or may not be in the relation. In this case, the properties of being symmetric and not necessarily symmetric are not opposites; they are different concepts altogether. Therefore, Statement D is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only true statement among the given options is:\nB: Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = (1, 2), is 64.",
