Which of the following statements is true?\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm...let's see. Statement A talks about equivalence relations and partial-ordering relations. I remember that an equivalence relation is when things are the same, and a partial-ordering relation is when things are ordered in a certain way. So, statement A is saying that every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. That sounds a little tricky, so I'm not sure if that's true.\n\nStatement B is about the number of relations between sets A and B. I remember that to find the number of relations, you multiply the number of elements in set A by the number of elements in set B. So, if set A has 3 elements and set B has 2 elements, the number of relations would be 3 x 2 = 6. So, statement B is saying that the number of relations between A and B is 64. That sounds like a really big number, so I'm not sure if that's true either.\n\nStatement C is talking about an empty relation being reflexive. I remember that a relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. But if the relation is empty, that means there are no elements at all, so none of them can be related to themselves. So, I think statement C is true.\n\nFinally, statement D is saying that the properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other. I remember that a relation is symmetric if whenever x is related to y, y is related to x. And a relation is asymmetric if x being related to y means y can't be related to x. So, I think statement D is saying that these two properties are opposites of each other, like in math when two numbers are negatives of each other. So, statement D might be true too.\n\nIn the end, I think statement C and statement D might be true, but I'm not sure about A or B. I'll have to think about them some more.",
