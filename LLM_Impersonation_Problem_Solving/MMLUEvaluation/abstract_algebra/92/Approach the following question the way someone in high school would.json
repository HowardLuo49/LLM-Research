Which of the following statements is true?\nA: Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nB: Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\nC: Empty relation _ is reflexive\nD: Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "The correct statement is C: Empty relation _ is reflexive. This is because for a relation to be reflexive, it must contain all elements of the set it is defined on, and since an empty relation contains no elements, it automatically satisfies the reflexive property.",
    "solution_prompt": "Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following equal to B?: The correct statement is C: Empty relation _ is reflexive. This is because for a relation to be reflexive, it must contain all elements of the set it is defined on, and since an empty relation contains no elements, it automatically satisfies the reflexive property.",
