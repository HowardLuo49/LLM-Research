    "gpt_response": "Approach:\nLet us first analyze the statements given:\nStatement 1: Every field is also a ring.\nA field is a set with two operations defined on it - addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties (like closure, associativity, commutativity, distributive property, existence of additive identity, existence of additive inverses, existence of multiplicative identity, and existence of multiplicative inverses). A ring is also a set with two operations defined on it - addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties (like closure, associativity, commutativity, distributive property, existence of additive identity). \nSo, every field is a ring because all the properties required for a ring are already satisfied by a field.\n\nStatement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.\nFor a set to be a ring, it must satisfy some properties, including the existence of an additive identity and existence of multiplicative identity. So, every ring does have a multiplicative identity.\n\nTherefore, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true. Thus, the correct answer is:\nA: True, True.",
