    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by remembering that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extension as a vector space over the base field. In this case, our base field is Q (the rational numbers).\n\nWe have the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q, which means we are adding the element sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) to Q.\n\nTo find the degree of this field extension, we need to determine how many linearly independent elements we get when we adjoin sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) to Q. \n\nSince sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(6), we are actually just adding sqrt(6) to Q. It turns out that {1, sqrt(6)} forms a basis for Q(sqrt(6)) over Q, since 1 and sqrt(6) are linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(6)) over Q is 2. \n\nSo, the correct answer is C: 2.",
