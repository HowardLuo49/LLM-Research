    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. The field extension is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. So, that means we have the square roots of 2 and 3. To find the degree, we just need to count how many square roots we have. I see we have 2 square roots, so the degree must be 2! That means the answer is C: 2. Yay!",
