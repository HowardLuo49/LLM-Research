    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) over Q, we first need to determine a basis for this field extension. \n\nLet \u03b1 = \u221a2 + \u221a3. We can write \u03b1^2 = (\u221a2 + \u221a3)^2 = 2 + 2\u221a(2*3) + 3 = 5 + 2\u221a6. \n\nTherefore, \u03b1 = (5 + 2\u221a6)^1/2. \n\nIn general, any element in Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) can be written as a linear combination of 1, \u221a2, \u221a3, and \u221a6 using the above expression for \u03b1. \n\nNow, we need to determine if 1, \u221a2, \u221a3, and \u221a6 are linearly independent over Q. This can be done by checking if the determinant of the matrix formed by these elements is non-zero. \n\nBy calculating the determinant of the matrix formed by 1, \u221a2, \u221a3, and \u221a6, we see that it is non-zero. Therefore, they form a basis for the field extension Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) over Q. \n\nSince the basis has 4 elements, the degree of the field extension Q(\u221a2 + \u221a3) over Q is 4. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 4.",
