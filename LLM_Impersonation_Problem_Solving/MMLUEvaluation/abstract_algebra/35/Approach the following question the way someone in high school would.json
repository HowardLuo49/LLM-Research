    "gpt_response": "To find the degree for the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, we need to determine how many basis elements are needed to generate the field. Since both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are algebraic over Q and are linearly independent, the degree of the field extension is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions.\n\nThe degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2, as sqrt(2) is a root of the irreducible polynomial x^2 - 2.\n\nSimilarly, the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2, as sqrt(3) is a root of the irreducible polynomial x^2 - 3.\n\nTherefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the answer is B: 4.",
