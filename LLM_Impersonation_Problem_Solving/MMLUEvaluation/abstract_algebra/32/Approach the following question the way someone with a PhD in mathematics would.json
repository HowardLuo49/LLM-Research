This is a fundamental property of finite dimensional vector spaces and is a consequence of the basis being a maximal linearly independent set.\n\nStatement 2: If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\nThis statement is also true because any two bases of the same finite dimensional vector space must have the same number of vectors. This is a consequence of the dimension of the vector space being well-defined and bases being sets of vectors that span the entire space and are linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: True, True.",
