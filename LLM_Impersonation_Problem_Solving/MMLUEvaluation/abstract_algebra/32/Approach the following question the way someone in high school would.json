Okay, for the first statement, I remember that in a finite dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to form a basis. So, I think the first statement is true. \nNow, for the second statement, I remember that in a vector space, all bases have the same number of vectors, which is called the dimension of the vector space. So, I think the second statement is also true. \nTherefore, I would say that the answer is A: True, True.",
