    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's remember that the inverse of a number is what we need to multiply by to get 1. In this case, the number is -i. So we need to figure out what to multiply -i by to get 1. Let's think of it like a little math puzzle! \n\nIf we multiply -i by i, we get -i * i = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo the answer is i! Yay for math puzzles! So the answer is: C) i.",
