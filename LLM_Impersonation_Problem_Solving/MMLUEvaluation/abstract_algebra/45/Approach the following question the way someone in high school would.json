Well, that seems possible because we can always find a way to map elements from one group to another while preserving the group structure.\n\nNow, statement 2 says that every homomorphism is a one-to-one map. That doesn't sound right to me because a homomorphism can map multiple elements to the same element in another group while still preserving the group operation.\n\nSo, my final answer is: C) True, False",
