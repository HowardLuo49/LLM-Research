    "gpt_response": "Permutations are when you can change the order of things. Functions are when each input has only one output. So, in simple terms: Statement 1 is true because in a permutation, each thing is only used once. Statement 2 is false because not every function is a permutation - it has to be one-to-one for that to be true. So the answer is C: True, False.",
