And a one-to-one function is a function where each input has a unique output. So, I think this statement is true.\n\nNow, Statement 2 says every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one. Well, I'm not too sure about this one. I know that every permutation is a function, but I'm not sure if every function is a permutation. So, I'm going to say this statement is false.\n\nSo, my answer is C: True, False.",
