R is an integral domain if the product of any two non-zero elements in R is non-zero. \n\nFor a polynomial f(x) in R[x], the degree of f(x), denoted by deg f(x), is the highest power of x in the polynomial with a non-zero coefficient. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\nStatement 1: If a R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain.\nTo prove this statement, we need to show that R[x] is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. \nSince R is an integral domain, it is already a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. \nThus, by constructing R[x] as the ring of polynomials over R, we can see that R[x] inherits these properties from R.
