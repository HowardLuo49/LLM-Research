    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p. \n\nIn this case, 23 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 23. Therefore, we have:\n\n3^22 \u2261 1 (mod 23)\n\nTo find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can rewrite 3^47 as (3^22) * 3^25. Since 3^22 is congruent to 1 mod 23, we have:\n\n3^47 \u2261 1 * 3^25 \u2261 3^25 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can reduce 3^25 using Fermat's Little Theorem again:\n\n3^25 \u2261 3^(22+3) \u2261 (3^22) * 3^3 \u2261 1 * 27 \u2261 4 (mod 23)\n\nTherefore, the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23 is 4 (option D).",
