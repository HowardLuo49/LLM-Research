    "gpt_response": "Hey guys! So I was trying to solve this math problem and I used Fermat's theorem to find the remainder of 3^47 when it's divided by 23. Fermat's theorem states that if we have a prime number like 23 and a number like 3, then 3^22 is congruent to 1 (mod 23). \n\nSo, we can break down 3^47 into (3^22)^2 * 3^3. Since 3^22 is congruent to 1 (mod 23), we just need to find the remainder of 3^3 when divided by 23. \n\n3^3 = 27, which leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 23. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 4. Hope that makes sense!",
