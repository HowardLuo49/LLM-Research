    "gpt_response": "Hmm... Let's see. So when we divide 3^47 by 23, we want to find if there's a remainder. Fermat's theorem says that if p is prime and a is any integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 (mod p). In this case, 3 and 23 are both prime numbers! So we want to find the remainder when 3^46 is divided by 23, which should be 1. So when we multiply this by another 3, we get 3^47, which should have a remainder of 3 when divided by 23. So the answer is C: 3! Yay!",
