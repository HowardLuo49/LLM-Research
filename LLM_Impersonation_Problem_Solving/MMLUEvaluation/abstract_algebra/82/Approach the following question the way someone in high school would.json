    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. Statement 1 says that for every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n. So if we pick any positive integer, we can find a cyclic group with that order. That seems possible because there are different cyclic groups with different orders.\n\nNow, statement 2 says that every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group. This means that within a cyclic group, you can always find an element of any order that divides the group's order. That sounds true because in a cyclic group, you can keep raising an element to different powers and eventually get to any order.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: True, True.",
