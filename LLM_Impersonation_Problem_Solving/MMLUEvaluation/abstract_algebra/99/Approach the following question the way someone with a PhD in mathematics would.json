A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations.\n\nStatement 1: Every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring.\nThis statement is false. While every ideal is a subset of the ring, it may not necessarily contain the multiplicative identity of the ring or be closed under addition, so it may not satisfy the properties required to be a subring.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.\nThis statement is also false. While every subring is a subset of the ring and is closed under addition and multiplication, it may not be an ideal if it is not absorbing (multiplication by elements of the ring may not stay within the subring).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: False, False.",
