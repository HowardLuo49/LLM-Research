And since every ideal is a subring, that means it also follows all the rules of addition and subtraction in the ring. So, Statement 1 must be true!\n\nOn the other hand, when we have a subring of a ring, we know that it follows all the rules of addition and subtraction. But that doesn't necessarily mean it plays nicely with multiplication and is an ideal of the ring. So, Statement 2 is false!\n\nTherefore, the answer is True, False. Yay!",
