    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Umm, so like, for the first statement, every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring because like, an ideal is a subset of a ring that's closed under addition and multiplication by elements in the ring. And for the second statement, every subring of a ring is not necessarily an ideal of the ring because like, an ideal has to absorb products of ring elements. So I think it's like True, False. So, like, C?",
