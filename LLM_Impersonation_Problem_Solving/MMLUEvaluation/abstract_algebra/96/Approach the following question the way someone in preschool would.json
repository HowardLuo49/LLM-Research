    "gpt_response": "Okay! So we have the polynomial x^2 + 1 in the finite field Z_2. Let's first try plugging in 0 for x. 0^2 + 1 = 1. So 0 is not a zero of this polynomial. Now let's try plugging in 1 for x. 1^2 + 1 = 2. Since we are working in the finite field Z_2, 2 is equivalent to 0. So 1 is a zero of this polynomial. Therefore, the answer is B: 1.",
