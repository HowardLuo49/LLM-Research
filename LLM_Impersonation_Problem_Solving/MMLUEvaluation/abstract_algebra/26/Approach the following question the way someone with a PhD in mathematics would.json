    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we need to consider the structure of groups of order 42.\n\nThe number 42 can be factored as 2 * 3 * 7.

Therefore, Statement 1 (Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7) is true for the cyclic group of order 42.\n\nFor the non-abelian group of order 42, it does not have a normal subgroup of order 8, but it does have a normal subgroup of order 7. Hence, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false for the non-abelian group of order 42.\n\nSince there exists a group of order 42 for which Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, the correct answer is C: True, False.",
