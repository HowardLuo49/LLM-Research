    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so we know that the order of a group is 42. In statement 1, it says that every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7. That seems possible because 42 can be factored into 2 * 3 * 7, so there could be a subgroup of order 7. But for statement 2, it says every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8. I'm not so sure about that one because 42 can't be factored into 8. So, I think statement 1 is true but statement 2 is false. So, I'll go with answer choice C: True, False.",
