    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that y = f(x) is a solution of the differential equation x dy + (y - xe^x) dx = 0. And also that y = 0 when x = 1. \n\nLet's try to solve this by first finding the general solution of the differential equation. We can rewrite the equation as dy/dx = (xe^x - y)/x. \n\nNow, we can rewrite this as dy/(xe^x - y) = dx/x. Integrating both sides, we get ln|xe^x - y| = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration. \n\nThis gives us xe^x - y = Cx, where C = e^C. \n\nNow, we know that y = 0 when x = 1. So, plugging in these values, we get e - 0 = C, which means C = e. \n\nSubstitute C = e back into the equation, we get xe^x - y = ex. Rearranging, we get y = xe^x - ex. \n\nNow, we need to find the value of f(2) when x = 2. Plugging in x = 2 into the equation, we get y = 2e^2 - 2e. \n\nThis simplifies to y = 2e(e - 1). \n\nSo, the value of f(2) is 2e(e - 1), which simplifies to 2e^2 - 2e. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 2e.",
