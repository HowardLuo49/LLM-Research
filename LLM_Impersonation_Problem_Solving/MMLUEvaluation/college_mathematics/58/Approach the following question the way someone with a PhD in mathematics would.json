    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, we first need to find the next intersection point of the curves y = (sin x + cos x)^4 and y = (sin x - cos x)^4 after x = 0.\n\nThe key observation here is that the curves will intersect again when sin x + cos x = sin x - cos x, which simplifies to cos x = 0. This occurs at x = \u03c0/2, which is the next intersection point.\n\nNow, we need to determine the area between these curves from x = 0 to x = \u03c0/2.\n\nTo do this, we need to calculate the definite integral of the difference between the two curves over the interval [0, \u03c0/2].
