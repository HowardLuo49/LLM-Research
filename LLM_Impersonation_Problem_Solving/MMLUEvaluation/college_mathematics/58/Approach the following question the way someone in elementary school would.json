    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we have the curves y = (sin x + cos x)^4 and y = (sin x - cos x)^4 that intersect at x = 0. We need to find the smallest positive value of x where they intersect again and then find the area between them from x = 0 to that value.\n\nTo find the next intersection, we need to find where the y values are equal for both curves. Since the curves are symmetrical, we only need to look at the first quarter of the unit circle (from 0 to \u03c0/2).\n\nIf we substitute x = 0 into both equations, we get y = (1 + 1)^4 = 2^4 = 16 for both curves. So, the curves intersect at x = 0, and the next intersection will also be at x = 0.\n\nTherefore, the area between these curves from x = 0 to x = 0 is 0. The answer is not any of the choices given.",
