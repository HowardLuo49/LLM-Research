    "gpt_response": "Let's find the equation of the line that just touches the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0. To do this, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 and a point on the line.\n\nWhen x = 0, y = 0 + e^0 = 1. So the point we have is (0, 1).\n\nNow, let's find the slope of the tangent line at x = 0. We can do this by finding the derivative of y = x + e^x, which is y' = 1 + e^x. When x = 0, the slope of the tangent line is 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow we have a point (0, 1) and a slope of 2. Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, y - y1 = m(x - x1), we can plug in the values to get the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - 0)\ny - 1 = 2x\ny = 2x + 1\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + 1. So, the answer is A.",
