    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the equation of the line that is tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0. To do this, we need to find the derivative of the function y = x + e^x. The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of x is just 1. So, the derivative of y = x + e^x is y' = 1 + e^x.\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at x = 0. So we plug in x = 0 into the derivative to get the slope at that point. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow we have the slope of the tangent line, and we also know that the tangent line passes through the point (0, 0) because that's where x = 0.\n\nSo now we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\ny - 0 = 2(x - 0)\n\ny = 2x\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x, which is option B.",
