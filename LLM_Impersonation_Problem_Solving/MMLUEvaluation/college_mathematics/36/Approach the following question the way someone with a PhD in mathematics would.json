    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at that point and then use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x:\ndy/dx = 1 + e^x.\n\nEvaluate the derivative at x = 0:\ndy/dx \u2223 x=0 = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow, we have the slope of the tangent line at x = 0, which is 2. We also know that the point of tangency is (0, 1) (since at x = 0, y = 0 + e^0 = 1).\n\nNow, we use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\ny - y1 = m(x - x1),\nwhere m is the slope of the line, and (x1, y1) is the point of tangency.\n\nSubstitute the values we have:\ny - 1 = 2(x - 0),\ny - 1 = 2x,\ny = 2x + 1.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line tangent to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is y = 2x + 1.
