A university\u2019s mathematics department has 10 professors and will offer 20 different courses next semester. Each professor will be assigned to teach exactly 2 of the courses, and each course will have exactly one professor assigned to teach it. If any professor can be assigned to teach any course, how many different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses are possible?\nA: 20!/2^(10)\nB: 10!/2^9\nC: 10^(20) - 2^(10)\nD: 10^(20) - 100",

So, we need to figure out how many ways we can assign the professors to the courses. Let's see... Oh, I remember in math class we learned about permutations and combinations. I think we need to use permutations here because the order matters. So, the formula for permutations is n!/(n-r)!. But wait, each professor has to teach 2 courses, so we have to divide by 2!. Let's see... Oh, I think the answer is A: 20!/2^(10). That makes sense because we have 20 courses and 10 professors, so 20!/(2!*2!*2!*2!*2!*2!*2!*2!*2!*2!) = 20!/2^(10). Yay, I did it!",
