    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers \\(k\\) such that the ordinary decimal representation of the integer \\(k!\\) ends in exactly 99 zeros, we need to consider the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of \\(k!\\).\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of a number is determined by the number of pairs of factors of 2 and 5. Since there will always be more factors of 2 than 5 in the prime factorization of any factorial, we only need to consider the number of factors of 5.\n\nFor a number to end in exactly 99 zeros, it needs to have at least 99 factors of 5 in its prime factorization. We know that the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of a number is determined by the power of 5 in the prime factorization of that number.\n\nTo determine the possible values of \\(k\\), we need to find the highest power of 5 that divides \\(k!\\). This can be calculated by repeatedly dividing \\(k\\) by 5 until the result is less than 5. The number of times we can divide \\(k\\) by 5 will give us the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of \\(k!\\).\n\nSince we need at least 99 factors of 5 in the prime factorization of \\(k!\\) to end in exactly 99 zeros, the possible values of \\(k\\) will be the smallest positive integers greater than or equal to 99 that have at least 99 factors of 5 in their prime factorizations.\n\nThrough calculation, it can be determined that there are no such positive integers, so the answer is none. Therefore, option A: None, is the correct answer.",
