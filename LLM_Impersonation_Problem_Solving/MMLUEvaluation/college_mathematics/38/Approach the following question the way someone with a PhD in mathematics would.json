    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to analyze both statements using mathematical rigor.\n\nLet's start with statement 1. The given information states that the series \u2211|a_i| diverges and \u2211 a_i = 2. This implies that the terms of the series do not converge to zero. By the Riemann rearrangement theorem, we can rearrange the terms of a conditionally convergent series to achieve any real number or to diverge. Therefore, statement 1 is true.\n\nNext, let's analyze statement 2. The statement asserts the existence of metric spaces X and Y with X being closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. This statement is false by the Heine-Borel theorem which states that in Euclidean space, a subset is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B: True, False.",
