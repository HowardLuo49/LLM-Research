    "gpt_response": "Okay, so for Statement 1, we know that the sum of the absolute values of a series diverges, but the sum of the series itself equals 2. This means that there is a rearrangement of the terms that adds up to 4. That sounds possible to me, so I'm going to say Statement 1 is True.\n\nNow for Statement 2, it says there are metric spaces X and Y where X is closed and bounded, a continuous function is mapped from X to Y, but f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. This seems a little weird to me, but I guess it could be true. So I'm going to say Statement 2 is also True.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is A: True, True.",
