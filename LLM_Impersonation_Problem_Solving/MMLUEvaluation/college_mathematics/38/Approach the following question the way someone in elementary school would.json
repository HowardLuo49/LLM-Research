    "gpt_response": "Um, for the first statement, it's saying that if the sum of absolute values of a series goes to infinity, and the sum of the series itself is equal to 2, then you can rearrange the terms to make the sum equal to 4. That sounds possible.\n\nFor the second statement, it's talking about something called metric spaces and mappings. It says there are spaces X and Y where X is closed and bounded, and there is a mapping that takes X to Y where Y is not closed and bounded. That also sounds possible.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: True, True.",
