    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to carefully analyze each statement using our knowledge and reasoning abilities.\n\nStatement 1:\nThis statement is a basic result from the properties of limits of sequences. If {s_n} and {t_n} converge to s and t respectively, then the product of the limits of the sequences {s_n} and {t_n} is equal to the limit of the product of the sequences, i.e., lim_n\u2192\u221e s_n t_n = s * t. This is a fundamental result in the theory of limits of sequences, and therefore Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2:\nThis statement is related to the concept of bounded sequences and convergent subsequences. In general, the existence of a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence is possible. One example of this is the alternating sequence {(-1)^n}, which is bounded between -1 and 1 but has no convergent subsequence.
