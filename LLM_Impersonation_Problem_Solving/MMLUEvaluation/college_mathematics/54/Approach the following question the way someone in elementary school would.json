So, there are exactly two abelian groups of order 4.\n\nOption B: 7\nThere's only one abelian group of order 7, which is Z7. So, this is not the answer.\n\nOption C: 8\nWe have the abelian group Z8 and Z2 x Z4. So, there are exactly two abelian groups of order 8.\n\nOption D: 12\nWe have Z12, Z3 x Z4, and Z2 x Z6.
