    "gpt_response": "In order to determine which statement is not always true for x, y, z \u2208 R^k, we must analyze each statement individually based on mathematical properties.\n\nStatement A: |x| \u2265 0\nThis statement is always true for any element x in R^k. By definition, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, so |x| is always greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, Statement A is always true.\n\nStatement B: |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y|\nThis statement is known as the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, a fundamental inequality in mathematics. It states that for any vectors x and y in an inner product space, the magnitude of their dot product is always less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. Therefore, Statement B is always true.\n\nStatement C: |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0\nThis statement is also always true. The absolute value of a real number is only equal to zero when the number itself is equal to zero. This is a basic property of absolute value and holds true in all cases.\n\nStatement D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|\nThis statement is not always true. The Triangle Inequality for absolute values states that the absolute value of the sum of two numbers is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values of the two numbers. Therefore, |x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y| holds, but the equality |x + y| = |x| + |y| is not always true. \n\nIn conclusion, the statement that is not always true for x, y, z \u2208 R^k is Statement D: |x + y| = |x| + |y|.",
