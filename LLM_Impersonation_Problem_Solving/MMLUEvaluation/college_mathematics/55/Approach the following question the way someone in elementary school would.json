    "gpt_response": "Ok, so for this question, we have to pick the one that is not always true for x, y, z in R^k. \n\nA. It says |x| is greater than or equal to 0. Well, since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, this is true. So, A is always true.\n\nB. It says the absolute value of x times y is always less than or equal to the absolute value of x times the absolute value of y. Well, this is true too because of the triangle inequality. So, B is always true.\n\nC. It says the absolute value of x is equal to 0 if and only if x is equal to 0. This is also true because the absolute value of a number is 0 only when the number itself is 0. C is always true.\n\nD. Lastly, it says the absolute value of x plus y is always equal to the absolute value of x plus the absolute value of y. This is not always true because of the triangle inequality. So, the answer is D.",
