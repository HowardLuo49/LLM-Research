And I know that when you multiply two numbers, it's equal to or smaller than if you multiply their absolute values, so |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y| should be true. Oh! I remember that if the absolute value of a number is 0, then that number must be 0 too, so |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0 is also true. But for the last one, |x + y| = |x| + |y|, I'm not so sure. Sometimes when you add two numbers, the absolute value might be different than just adding their absolute values.
