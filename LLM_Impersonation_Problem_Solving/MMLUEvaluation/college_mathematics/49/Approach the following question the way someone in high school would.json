If f: R -> R is a bounded function that is Lebesgue integrable, then which of the following must be true?\nA: f is Riemann integrable.\nB: There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nC: There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nD: None of the above.",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so we know that f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's Riemann integrable. So I think option A is not necessarily true. As for option B, it's saying there can't be a countably infinite set where f is nondifferentiable at every point. I'm not sure about that one... And option C is similar, but with an uncountable set. I'm not really sure about that one either... So maybe the answer is D: None of the above? But I'm not completely confident in my answer.",
