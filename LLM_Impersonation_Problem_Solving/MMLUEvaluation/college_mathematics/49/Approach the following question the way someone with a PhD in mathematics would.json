If f: R -> R is a bounded function that is Lebesgue integrable, then which of the following must be true?\nA: f is Riemann integrable.\nB: There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nC: There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nD: None of the above.",

    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between Lebesgue integrability and Riemann integrability, as well as the properties of differentiation.\n\nSince f is a bounded function that is Lebesgue integrable, it is known that Lebesgue integrability implies Riemann integrability. Therefore, option A must be true. This is a well-known result in analysis.\n\nNext, we consider the properties of the function f in terms of differentiability. The Weierstrass function is an example of a bounded function that is nondifferentiable at every point in a countably infinite subset of real numbers. Therefore, option B is not necessarily true. However, it is possible for a bounded Lebesgue integrable function to be nondifferentiable at every point in an uncountable subset of real numbers. Thus, option C must also be false.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is D: None of the above.",
