If f: R -> R is a bounded function that is Lebesgue integrable, then which of the following must be true?\nA: f is Riemann integrable.\nB: There does not exist a countably infinite E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nC: There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\nD: None of the above.",

So, I think A might be true because if it can be split up like that, maybe it can also be split up using Riemann integrals. But I'm not too sure about the other ones. Maybe B and C could be true too, because if f is nondifferentiable at every point in E, that might mean it's not Riemann integrable. But maybe I need to ask my teacher for help with this question. So, I'm not sure. Let's go with D: None of the above.",
