It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Kate needs k days to write a GRE math practice test, and John needs j days. \n\nWhen Kate starts, it takes them 10 days to complete a test in alternating shifts. That means Kate works for 5 days and John works for 4 days. \n\nSimilarly, when John starts, it takes them 10.5 days to complete a test in alternating shifts. That means John works for 5.25 days and Kate works for 4.25 days. \n\nSo, Kate can complete 1/k of the test in a day, and John can complete 1/j of the test in a day. \n\nWhen they work together, they complete 1/k + 1/j of the test in a day. \n\nTherefore, the time taken for them to complete the test together is 1 / (1/k + 1/j) days. \n\nThis simplifies to (kj) / (k + j) days. \n\nTherefore, the time taken for the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously is kj / (k + j) days, which is equivalent to option C: 41/8 days.",
