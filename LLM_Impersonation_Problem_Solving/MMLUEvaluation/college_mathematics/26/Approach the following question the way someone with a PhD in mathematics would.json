It takes John j days to write a GRE math practice test. If Kate and John work on a practice test in alternating 2-day shifts, it takes them 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts. How long would it take the two to complete a practice test if Kate and John worked simultaneously?\nA: 9/2 days\nB: 5 days\nC: 41/8 days\nD: 36/7 days",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of days it takes Kate to write a GRE math practice test as k and the number of days it takes John as j.\n\nWhen Kate starts, the total time it takes for them to complete the test is 10 days. This means that Kate works for k days, and John works for 10 - k days. Since they work in 2-day shifts, Kate works for k + 2n days and John works for 10 - k - 2n days, where n is the number of shifts they complete.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation k + 2n = 10.\n\nWhen John starts, the total time it takes for them to complete the test is 10.5 days. This means that John works for j days, and Kate works for 10.5 - j days. Similarly, we can express this in terms of shifts, so we have the equation 10.5 - j + 2n = 10.5.\n\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get k = 3 and n = 2. Hence, it takes 3 days for Kate to complete the test and 4 days for John.\n\nTherefore, if they work simultaneously, it would take 1/(1/3 + 1/4) = 12/7 = 36/7 days to complete the practice test.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D: 36/7 days.",
