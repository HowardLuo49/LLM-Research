As the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. How fast, in meters per second, will the top end of the ladder be sliding downward at the moment the top end is 3 meters above the ground?\nA: 12*sqrt(2)\nB: 6*sqrt(2)\nC: 4*sqrt(2)\nD: 1/(2*sqrt(2))",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we know that the ladder is 9 meters long and the bottom end is moving away from the wall at 2 meters per second. We need to find out how fast the top end is sliding downward when it is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use related rates. Let x be the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder and y be the height of the ladder above the ground. According to the Pythagorean theorem, x^2 + y^2 = 9^2. \n\nWe are given that dx/dt = 2 m/s (rate at which the bottom of the ladder moves away from the wall) and we need to find dy/dt (rate at which the top of the ladder slides down) when y = 3.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 with respect to time t, we get:\n\n2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n2x(2) + 2(3)dy/dt = 0\n4x + 6 dy/dt = 0\ndy/dt = -4x/6\ndy/dt = -2x/3\n\nNow we need to find x when y = 3:\n\nx^2 + 3^2 = 9^2\nx^2 = 81 - 9\nx^2 = 72\nx = sqrt(72)\n\nNow plug in x = sqrt(72) into the equation for dy/dt to get the answer:\n\ndy/dt = -2sqrt(72)/3\ndy/dt = -2(6)sqrt(2)/3\ndy/dt = -12sqrt(2)/3\ndy/dt = -4sqrt(2)\n\nSince the rate of change is downward, we take the positive value:\n\ndy/dt = 4sqrt(2) \n\nSo, the top end of the ladder will be sliding downward at a rate of 4sqrt(2) meters per second. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 4sqrt(2) meters per second.",
