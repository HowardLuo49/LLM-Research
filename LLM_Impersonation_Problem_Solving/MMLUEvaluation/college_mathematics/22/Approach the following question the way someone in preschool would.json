If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see... if U is an additive subgroup of R and it's a right ideal, that means it's closed under multiplication on the right side. So if R has exactly two right ideals, that probably means it's not commutative because if it was, then U would also be a left ideal and there would be more than two ideals. So, I think option A: I only must be true!",
