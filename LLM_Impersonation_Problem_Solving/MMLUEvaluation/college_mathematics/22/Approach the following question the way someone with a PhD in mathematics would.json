If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we must first understand the definitions of the terms involved. A ring is a structure consisting of a set equipped with two binary operations, usually addition and multiplication, which satisfy certain properties such as associativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive and multiplicative identities. An additive subgroup of a ring is a subset that is closed under addition, contains the additive identity, and contains the additive inverses of its elements. A right ideal of a ring is a subset that is an additive subgroup and is closed under right multiplication by elements of the ring.\n\nGiven that R has exactly two right ideals, let's consider the implications of each statement:\n\nI. If R is commutative, then any subset of R that is an additive subgroup will automatically be a right ideal since the right multiplication operation is commutative. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\nII. If R is a division ring, then every element in R except the additive identity will have a multiplicative inverse. This implies that any non-zero element can be multiplied with any other element to give a non-zero result, ensuring that any additive subgroup will be closed under right multiplication, making it a right ideal. Therefore, this statement must also be true.\n\nIII. The size of the ring does not necessarily impact the existence of right ideals, so this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
