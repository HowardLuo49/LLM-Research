If U is an additive subgroup of R such that ur in U for all u in U and for all r in R, then U is said to be a right ideal of R. If R has exactly two right ideals, which of the following must be true?\nI. R is commutative.\nII. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).\nIII. R is infinite.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "Oh man, this question is making my head hurt. But let's break it down. We know that R has exactly two right ideals. So, we need to figure out what properties R must have based on that information.\n\nOkay, so if U is an additive subgroup of R and it's a right ideal, that means that for every element in U and every element in R, their product is also in U. So, it's kind of like multiplication distributes over U. If R is commutative, then we know that it satisfies this property. So, that means I must be true.\n\nAs for II, for R to be a division ring, that means every non-zero element in R must have a multiplicative inverse. We don't necessarily know that from the info given in the question, so II doesn't have to be true.\n\nAnd for III, well, we don't have any information about the size of R. It could be finite or infinite, so there's nothing we can say for sure about that. So, III doesn't have to be true either.\n\nBased on that, I'd say the answer is D, since I is true and II might be true because of the commutativity of R.",
