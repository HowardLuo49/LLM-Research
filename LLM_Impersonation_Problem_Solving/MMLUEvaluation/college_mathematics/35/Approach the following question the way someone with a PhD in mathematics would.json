    "gpt_response": "To find the equation of the torus generated by revolving the circle C around the z-axis, we first need to parametrize the circle in the yz-plane. The circle C has the equation (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1. \n\nTo parametrize this circle, we can let y = 3 + cos(t) and z = sin(t) where t ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0. This ensures that (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1 for all t.\n\nWhen this circle is revolved around the z-axis, we get a torus. The equation of this torus can be found using parametric equations. The parametric equations for a torus are:\n\nx = (R + rcos(s))cos(t)\ny = (R + rcos(s))sin(t)\nz = rsin(s)\n\nwhere R is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, r is the radius of the tube, and s and t range from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nIn this case, R = 3 and r = 1. Substituting these values into the equations for x, y, and z, we get:\n\nx = (3 + cos(s))cos(t)\ny = (3 + cos(s))sin(t)\nz = sin(s)\n\nFor the torus generated by revolving the circle C around the z-axis, the equation is:\n(x - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n(x - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\n\nThus, the correct equation for the torus is:\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)",
