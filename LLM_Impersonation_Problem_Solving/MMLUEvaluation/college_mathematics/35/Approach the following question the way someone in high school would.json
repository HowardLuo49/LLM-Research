If C is revolved around the z-axis, the surface generated is a torus. What is the equation of this torus?\nA: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6y\nB: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 8 + 36(x^2 + z^2)\nC: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\nD: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)",

    "gpt_response": "This is pretty different from what I've seen in math class before, but I know that when you revolve a circle around an axis, you get a torus. The equation for the circle is given as (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1. So, to get the equation of the torus, I'll need to revolve this circle around the z-axis. Looking at the options, I see that the equation that looks like it could be the one I need is option D: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2).\n\nSo, my final answer is D: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2).",
