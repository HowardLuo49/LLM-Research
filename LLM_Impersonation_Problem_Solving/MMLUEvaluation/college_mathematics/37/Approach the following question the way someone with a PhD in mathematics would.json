Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the dimension of the subspace kernel of T, we need to find the nullity of the linear transformation. The nullity of T is the dimension of the kernel of T, which is the set of all vectors in V that get mapped to the zero vector in W.\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it is a mapping from a 6-dimensional space (V) to a 4-dimensional space (W). By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel of T is given by:\n\nRank(T) + Nullity(T) = Dimension of V\nRank(T) + Nullity(T) = 6\n\nSince T is onto W, the rank of T is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4. Substituting this into the equation above:\n\n4 + Nullity(T) = 6\nNullity(T) = 6 - 4\nNullity(T) = 2\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T is 2. Thus, the answer is A: 2.",
