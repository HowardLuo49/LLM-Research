Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first we need to know what a linear transformation is. A linear transformation is like when you take a shape and move it around without changing its size or shape. In this case, we have real 2 x 3 matrices and real 4 x 1 column vectors. The subspace kernel of the linear transformation is where the vectors in V get sent to the zero vector in W.\n\nSince a 2 x 3 matrix has 6 entries and a 4 x 1 column vector has 4 entries, we can think of the linear transformation T as taking 6-dimensional vectors in V and converting them to 4-dimensional vectors in W. The kernel of T is the subspace of V that gets sent to the zero vector in W.\n\nSo, the dimension of the subspace kernel of T would be the number of vectors in V that get sent to zero in W. This depends on how many vectors in V get sent to zero. Since we have 6-dimensional vectors in V and 4-dimensional vectors in W, the dimension of the kernel of T would be 2.\n\nSo, the answer is A: 2.",
