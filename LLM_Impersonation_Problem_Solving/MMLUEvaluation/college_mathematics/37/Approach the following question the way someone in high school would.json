Let V be the real vector space of all real 2 x 3 matrices, and let W be the real vector space of all real 4 x 1 column vectors. If T is a linear transformation from V onto W, what is the dimension of the subspace kernel of T?\nA: 2\nB: 3\nC: 4\nD: 5",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Well, first things first, I know that the dimension of the domain, V, is 6 (2 rows x 3 columns = 6 entries), and the dimension of the codomain, W, is 4 (4 rows x 1 column = 4 entries).\n\nSince T is a linear transformation from V onto W, it means that T maps all elements of V to a corresponding element in W. This implies that the dimension of the image of T is equal to the dimension of W, which is 4.\n\nNow, we can use the rank-nullity theorem, which states that for a linear transformation T from a vector space V to a vector space W, the dimension of V is equal to the sum of the dimension of the kernel of T and the dimension of the image of T.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel of T is equal to the dimension of V - the dimension of the image of T, which is 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A) 2.",
