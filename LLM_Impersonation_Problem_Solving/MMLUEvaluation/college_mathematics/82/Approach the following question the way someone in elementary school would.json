So, 72 = 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nNow, we have to think about the possible ways we can combine these prime factors to form different Abelian groups. Since Abelian groups are groups where the operation is commutative, we can think about the possible ways to distribute these prime factors into groups of the same order.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a bit, I came up with 4 different ways to combine the prime factors to form distinct Abelian groups of order 72. So, the answer is A: 4!",
