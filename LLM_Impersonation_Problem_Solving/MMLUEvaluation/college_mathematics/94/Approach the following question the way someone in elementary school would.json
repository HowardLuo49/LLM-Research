    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find out what (1+i)^10 is equal to, we can use the distributive property to multiply it out. \n\n(1+i)^10 = (1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)(1+i)\n\nOkay, let's multiply that out. \n\n(1+i)(1+i) = 1 + i + i + i^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1\n= 2i \n\nSo, (1+i)^10 would be:\n\n(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i)(2i) \n\nHmmm, that's a lot of i's multiplying together. Let's see...\n\n2i * 2i = 4i^2, and since i^2 is equal to -1, then 4i^2 = 4(-1) = -4. \n\nSo the final answer would be -4. \n\nWhoops, I made a mistake in my multiplication there. Let's try again. \n\nWell, actually, (1+i)^10 is a lot to calculate by hand. Maybe I'll ask my teacher for help with this one. So the answer is... umm... I'm not sure. Can you help me with this one?",
