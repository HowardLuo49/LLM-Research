When we expand (1+i)^10, we get a long expression with a real part and an imaginary part.\n\n(1+i)^10 = 1 + 10i + 45i^2 + 120i^3 + 210i^4 + 252i^5 + 210i^6 + 120i^7 + 45i^8 + 10i^9 + i^10\n\nBecause i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1, the expression simplifies to:\n\n(1+i)^10 = 1 + 10i - 45 + 120(-i) + 210 + 252i - 210 - 120i + 45 - 10i + 1\n\nThen, we can combine like terms to get:\n\n(1+i)^10 = -682 + 904i\n\nSo the answer is not listed above.
