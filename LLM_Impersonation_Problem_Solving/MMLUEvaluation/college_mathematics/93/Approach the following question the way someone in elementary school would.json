The probability that a point (x, y) in R^2 is chosen follows a uniform random distribution within the region described by the inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 .

The area of this square is 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the area where 2(x + y) > 1. This region is a triangle with vertices at (1/2,0), (0,1/2), and (-1/2,0). The area of this triangle is 1/4.\n\nSo, the probability that a point (x, y) in R^2 will be in the triangle where 2(x + y) > 1 is 1/4. Therefore, the answer is B: 1/4.",
