If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nA: I and II only\nB: III only\nC: I and III only\nD: I, II, and III",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. If A is inside C, and both A and C are connected, then B should also be connected. So, I is true. Next, if both A and C are compact, then B should also be compact. So, II is true as well. As for III, if A and C are Hausdorff, then B doesn't necessarily have to be Hausdorff. So, the answer is A: I and II only.",
