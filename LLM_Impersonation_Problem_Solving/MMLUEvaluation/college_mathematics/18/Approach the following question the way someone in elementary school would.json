    "gpt_response": "Let's look at each statement one by one.\n\nI. If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\nThis statement is true because if A and C are connected, and A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then B is also connected. So, statement I is true.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\nThis statement is also true because if A and C are compact, and A is a subset of B and B is a subset of C, then B is also compact. So, statement II is true.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Just because A and C are Hausdorff spaces, it does not mean that B must be Hausdorff as well. So, statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I and II only.",
