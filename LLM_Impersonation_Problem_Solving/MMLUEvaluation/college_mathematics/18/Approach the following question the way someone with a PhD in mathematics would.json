If A and C are connected, then B is connected:\nThis statement is true. Any subset of a connected space is connected, so if A and C are connected and A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, then B must also be connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact:\nThis statement is true as well. In a topological space, if A and C are compact, then any subset of a compact space is compact. Therefore, B must also be compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff:\nThis statement is false. Being a subset of a Hausdorff space does not necessarily mean that B is Hausdorff. A Hausdorff space is a topological space in which any two distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods. Being a subset of a Hausdorff space does not necessarily preserve this property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA: I and II only",
