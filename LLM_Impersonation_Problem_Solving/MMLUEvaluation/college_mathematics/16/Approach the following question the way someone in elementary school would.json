Call the set of matrices from V into itself M(V). Let T be in M(V). Consider the two subspaces U = {X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT} and W = {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}. Which of the following must be TRUE?\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\nIII. dim (U) < n\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "I would approach this question by first looking at what each part is asking. It seems like we are looking at subspaces U and W of M(V) based on a matrix transformation T.\n\nFor part I, it mentions eigenvectors of T. I know that eigenvectors are vectors that point in the same direction after a transformation, so if a basis consists only of eigenvectors, then U might equal M(V).\n\nFor part II, it talks about the dimensions of U and W adding up to n^2. I know that the dimension of a space is like how many \"directions\" or \"degrees of freedom\" it has, so this seems reasonable.\n\nFor part III, it says the dimension of U is less than n. This makes sense because we are looking at a subspace of M(V), which is already of dimension n, so U should have fewer dimensions.\n\nTherefore, based on my understanding, I would guess that the answer is D: I and II only.",
