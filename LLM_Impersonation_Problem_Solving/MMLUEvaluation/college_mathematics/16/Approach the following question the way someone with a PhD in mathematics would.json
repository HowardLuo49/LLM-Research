Call the set of matrices from V into itself M(V). Let T be in M(V). Consider the two subspaces U = {X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT} and W = {TX \u2212 XT : X \u2208 M(V)}.

    "gpt_response": "To approach this question in a way that a person with a PhD in mathematics would, we would analyze each statement carefully.\n\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V):\nIf T has a basis containing only eigenvectors, it means that T is diagonalizable. In this case, every matrix in M(V) commutes with T because they can be simultaneously diagonalized with T. Therefore, U = M(V). So, statement I is true.\n\nII. dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2:\nWe know that dim(U) = dim({X \u2208 M(V) : TX = XT}) = dim({X \u2208 M(V) : TX \u2212 XT = 0}). This is the dimension of the centralizer of T in M(V), which is known to be equal to the dimension of the commutant. Thus, dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2. So, statement II is also true.\n\nIII. dim(U) < n:\nSince dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2, if dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2, it implies dim(U) < n. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer will be D: I and II only.",
