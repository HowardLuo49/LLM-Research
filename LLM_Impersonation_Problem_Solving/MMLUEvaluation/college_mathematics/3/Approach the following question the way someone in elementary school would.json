So the point (4, 2) is on the curve. \n\nNow, we can use the distance formula to find the distance from (4, 2) to the origin (which is (0, 0)). \n\nThe distance formula is: D = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get: \nD = sqrt((0 - 4)^2 + (0 - 2)^2)\nD = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-2)^2)\nD = sqrt(16 + 4)\nD = sqrt(20)\nD = 2sqrt(5)\n\nSo, the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin is 2sqrt(5), which is not one of the answer choices given.
