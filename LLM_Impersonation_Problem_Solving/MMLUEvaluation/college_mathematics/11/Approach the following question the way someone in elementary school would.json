Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have two random variables, X and Y. They are both positive integers and the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. This means that the probability of X being 1 is 1/2, the probability of X being 2 is 1/4, the probability of X being 3 is 1/8, and so on.\n\nNow we want to find the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3. This means we need to find the probability that both X and Y are not 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSince X and Y are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of X and Y not being 1, 2, or 3. \n\nSo the probability of both X and Y not being 1, 2, or 3 is (1 - 1/2 - 1/4 - 1/8) * (1 - 1/2 - 1/4 - 1/8) = (1 - 7/8) * (1 - 7/8) = 1/8 * 1/8 = 1/64.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 1/64.",
