Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",

    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3, we can first find the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3, and then subtract this probability from 1.\n\nThe probability that X is less than or equal to 3 is:\nP(X \u2264 3) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 = 7/8.\n\nSince X and Y are independent with the same probability distribution, the probability that Y is less than or equal to 3 is also 7/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability that both X and Y are less than or equal to 3 is:\nP(X \u2264 3, Y \u2264 3) = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) = (7/8) * (7/8) = 49/64.\n\nFinally, the probability that at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 is:\nP(X > 3 or Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \u2264 3, Y \u2264 3) = 1 - 49/64 = 15/64.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 15/64.",
