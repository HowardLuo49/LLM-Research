Suppose X is a discrete random variable on the set of positive integers such that for each positive integer n, the probability that X = n is 1/2^n. If Y is a random variable with the same probability distribution and X and Y are independent, what is the probability that the value of at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 ?\nA: 1/64\nB: 15/64\nC: 1/4\nD: 3/8",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Um, so we know that X and Y are independent random variables with the probability distribution of 1/2^n for each positive integer n. We want to find the probability that at least one of them is greater than 3. \n\nFirst, let's find the probability that X is greater than 3: \nP(X > 3) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6) + ... \n            = 1/2^4 + 1/2^5 + 1/2^6 + ...\n            = 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ...\n            = 1/8\n\nSince X and Y are independent, the probability that at least one of them is greater than 3 will be the complement of the probability that neither X nor Y is greater than 3. \n\nP(neither X nor Y > 3) = P(X \u2264 3 and Y \u2264 3) \n                           = P(X \u2264 3) * P(Y \u2264 3) (because X and Y are independent)\n                           = (1 - P(X > 3)) * (1 - P(Y > 3))\n                           = (1 - 1/8) * (1 - 1/8)\n                           = 7/8 * 7/8\n                           = 49/64\n\nSo, the probability that at least one of the variables X and Y is greater than 3 is:\nP(at least one > 3) = 1 - P(neither X nor Y > 3) \n                           = 1 - 49/64\n                           = 15/64\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 15/64.",
