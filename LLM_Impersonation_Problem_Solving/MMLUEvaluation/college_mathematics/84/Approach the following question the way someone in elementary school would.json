    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have this function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy. We need to find points where this function has a local maximum or a saddle point.\n\nTo find these points, we have to take the partial derivatives of the function with respect to x and y. Then we need to set these partial derivatives equal to zero and solve for x and y. \n\nAfter doing all that math stuff, we find that there are points P and Q where this function has a local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q. \n\nSo the answer is C: local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q.",
