Then there exist distinct points P and Q such that f has a\nA: local maximum at P and at Q\nB: saddle point at P and at Q\nC: local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q\nD: local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we need to find the critical points of the function f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy. To do that, we need to find where the partial derivatives are equal to 0.\n\nTaking the partial derivative with respect to x, we get:\ndf/dx = 3x^2 + 3y = 0\nThis gives us x^2 + y = 0\nTaking the partial derivative with respect to y, we get:\ndf/dy = 3y^2 + 3x = 0\nThis gives us y^2 + x = 0\n\nSolving these two equations together, we get y = -1 and x = 1 as the critical point. So, the point P where f has a local minimum is (1, -1).\n\nNow we need to find the point where f has a saddle point. To do this, we can use the second partial derivative test. We calculate the Hessian matrix of f:\n\nHessian matrix:\n[6x 3]\n[3 6y]\n\nAt the point P (1, -1), the Hessian matrix is:\n[6 3]\n[3 -6]\n\nCalculate the determinant of the Hessian matrix:\ndet(H) = (6)(-6) - (3)(3) = -36 - 9 = -45\n\nSince the determinant is negative, and the second derivative test tells us that we have a saddle point at a critical point where the determinant is negative, we conclude that the function f has a local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q. Therefore, the answer is C.",
