    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so a 10-gon is a shape with 10 sides. And they're asking for the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon, which means all the angles are less than 90 degrees. \n\nSince a convex 10-gon has 10 sides, that means it also has 10 angles. To find the maximum number of acute angles, we need to figure out how many angles could be less than 90 degrees if we were to draw the 10-gon as a regular polygon.\n\nA regular polygon is one where all sides and angles are equal. In a regular 10-gon, each interior angle is 144 degrees. \n\nTo figure out the maximum number of acute angles in a 10-gon, we need to think about how many of those 144-degree angles could be less than 90 degrees. Since an acute angle is less than 90 degrees, that means only 6 of the interior angles could be acute.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA: 1\n\nBecause in a regular 10-gon, there will only be 1 acute angle since there are only 6 angles less than 90 degrees.",
