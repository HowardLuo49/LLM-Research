    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's start by thinking about what an acute angle is. An acute angle is an angle that is less than 90 degrees. \n\nNow, a convex 10-gon is a shape with 10 sides and all the angles inside the shape are less than 180 degrees (which makes it convex).\n\nSo, let's think about it. In a convex shape with 10 sides, each angle will be less than 180 degrees. Since there are 10 angles in a 10-gon, we need to figure out how many of those angles can be acute (less than 90 degrees).\n\nIf we draw a 10-gon, we can see that at each vertex (corner) there are two angles. So, in a 10-gon with 10 sides, there are 10 vertices and therefore 10 angles.\n\nSince each vertex has two angles, one of those angles will always be acute (less than 90 degrees) and the other angle will be more than 90 degrees. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon in the Euclidean plane is B: 2.",
