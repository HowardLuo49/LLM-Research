Let k be the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1], and let n be the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1].

    "gpt_response": "Hmm... let's see. We have to find the number of real solutions in the interval [0, 1] and also the number of real solutions that are not in that interval. So, we have to count how many times the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 crosses the x-axis in each interval.\n\nSince we are in preschool, let's count together using our fingers! First, let's count the number of real solutions in the interval [0, 1]. Hmm... I see one solution in that interval. So, k = 1. Now, let's count the number of real solutions that are not in [0, 1]. I don't see any solutions outside the interval [0, 1]. So, n = 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: k = 1 and n = 0. Yay, we did it!",
