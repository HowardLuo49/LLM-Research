    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1], we first note that e^x is an increasing function, while x is a linear function. Additionally, the function e^x + x - 2 is continuous. \n\nSince the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 has a real solution when the function crosses the x-axis, the interval [0, 1] is finite and thus there exists a solution as the function is continuous. \n\nTo further evaluate the specific number of solutions, we can analyze the behavior of the function around the interval [0, 1]. By looking at the derivative of the function f(x) = e^x + x - 2, we can observe that f'(x) = e^x + 1 > 0 for all real x.\n\nThis implies that the function f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval [0, 1].
