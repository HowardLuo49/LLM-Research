    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we're looking to find the number of real solutions of the equation e^x + x - 2 = 0 in the interval [0, 1]. Let's start by trying to solve this equation.\n\nI know that the graph of y = e^x increases without bound, so it must cross the line y = 2 at some point before x = 1. I can tell this by plugging in 0 and 1 into the equation to see where the y-values are. \n\nWhen I plug in x = 0, I get e^0 + 0 - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1, so the value is negative. \nWhen I plug in x = 1, I get e^1 + 1 - 2 = e - 1 \u2248 1.718, so the value is positive.\n\nSince the graph crosses the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 1, there must be exactly one real solution in the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, the correct answer is B: k = 1 and n = 0.",
