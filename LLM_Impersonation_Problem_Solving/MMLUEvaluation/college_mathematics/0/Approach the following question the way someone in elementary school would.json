    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have an equation e^x + x - 2 = 0. First, we need to figure out how many real solutions there are between 0 and 1. So we need to find where this equation crosses the x-axis in that range.\n\nHmm, let's see. If we try different values of x, we see that there might be only one solution between 0 and 1. So k = 1.\n\nNow, let's look at how many solutions are there that are not between 0 and 1. Maybe there is another solution outside this range. So n = 1.\n\nSo which one is true? Oh, I think it's C: k = n = 1. Thank you!",
