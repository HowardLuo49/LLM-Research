    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what a linear transformation is. It's like when you move objects around on a grid in math class. So, we have a transformation T that moves the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3). \n\nNow, we want to find out what T does to the point (2, 1). To do that, we can think about how T changes points. Since T is a linear transformation, it will move points in a straight line.\n\nIf we look at the point (1, 2) and the point (-1, 2), we can see that T moves them to points that are on a line. So, if we draw a line connecting (1, 2) to (2, 3) and a line connecting (-1, 2) to (2, -3), we can find out where T will move the point (2, 1).\n\nConnecting (1, 2) to (2, 3), we see that the point (1, 2) moves 1 unit right and 1 unit up to get to (2, 3). \n\nConnecting (-1, 2) to (2, -3), we see that the point (-1, 2) moves 3 units right and 5 units down to get to (2, -3).\n\nNow, to find out where T moves the point (2, 1), we can try to connect it to both (1, 2) and (-1, 2), and try to follow the same pattern of movement. \n\nIf we connect (2, 1) to (1, 2), we can see that T would move the point (2, 1) 1 unit right and 1 unit up. This would bring it to the point (3, 2).\n\nSo, T maps the point (2, 1) to (3, 2). \n\nTherefore, the answer is C: (3, 2).",
