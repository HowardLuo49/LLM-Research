    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so first we need to remember that A equals A inverse. This means that if we multiply A by its inverse, we get the identity matrix which is usually just shown as I. We also know that the trace of a matrix is the sum of the main diagonal elements. Since A is equal to its inverse, that means A multiplied by A equals the identity matrix. \n\nWe have that A * A = I. So, let's write out what A and I would actually look like:\nA = [[a, b], [c, d]]\nI = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nNow, when we multiply A by itself, we get:\nA * A = [[a, b], [c, d]] * [[a, b], [c, d]] = [[a^2 + bc, ab + bd], [ac + dc, cb + d^2]]\n\nSince A * A equals I, we can set these equal to each other:\n[[a^2 + bc, ab + bd], [ac + dc, cb + d^2]] = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nFrom this, we see that a^2 + bc = d^2 = 1 and ab + bd = 0. This means that a = -d and b = 0.\n\nNow we can find the trace of A, which is just the sum of the main diagonal elements. In this case, the trace = a + d = a - a = 0. So the trace of A is C: 0.",
