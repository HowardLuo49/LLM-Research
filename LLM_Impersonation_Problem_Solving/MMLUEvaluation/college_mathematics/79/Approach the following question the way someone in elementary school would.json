    "gpt_response": "Statement 1 says that if A is connected, then the closure of A must be connected. That sounds right because if A is connected and we add in the points on the boundary of A to make the closure, it should still be connected. So, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 says that every continuous function on the interval (0, 1) has a fixed point. I'm not sure about this one because it doesn't seem like that would always be true. So, Statement 2 is false. That means the answer is B: True, False.",
