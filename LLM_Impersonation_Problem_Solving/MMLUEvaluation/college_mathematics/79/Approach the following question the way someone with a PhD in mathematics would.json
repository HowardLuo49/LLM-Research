    "gpt_response": "To approach this question as someone with a PhD in mathematics would, we would first think about the definitions and theorems involved.\n\nFor Statement 1: If A is connected, then its closure must also be connected. This is true because the closure of a set is the smallest closed set containing the given set, and connectedness is closed under taking subsets. Therefore, Statement 1 can be proven to be true.\n\nFor Statement 2: The statement \"Every continuous function f: (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point\" is known as the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, which is a fundamental result in topology and analysis. This theorem states that any continuous function from a closed ball in Euclidean space to itself must have a fixed point. The given statement is not the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, as it only considers the open interval (0, 1). Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: True, False.",
