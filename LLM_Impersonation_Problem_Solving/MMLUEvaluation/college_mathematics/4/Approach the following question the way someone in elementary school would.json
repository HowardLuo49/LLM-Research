    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first we need to think about how many ways we can choose 3 suitcases out of 25. It's like picking your favorite toys out of a big box! So we use combinations and find that there are 25 choose 3 ways to pick 3 suitcases. This is equal to 25! / (3! * (25-3)!) = 2300 ways.\n\nNext, we need to think about how many ways we can choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 5 damaged suitcases and 1 good suitcase out of the 20 good suitcases. This is like picking your favorite fruit snacks - some are yummy and some are icky! So we use combinations again and find that there are 5 choose 2 ways to pick 2 damaged suitcases and 20 choose 1 ways to pick 1 good suitcase. This is equal to (5! / (2! * (5-2)!) * (20! / (1! * (20-1)!) = 200 ways. \n\nFinally, we put it all together to find the probability. The probability of picking 2 damaged suitcases out of 3 is equal to the number of ways to pick 2 damaged suitcases and 1 good suitcase divided by the total number of ways to pick 3 suitcases. So the probability is 200/2300 = 2/23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 2/23. Great job picking out the right answer! Keep up the good work in math class!",
