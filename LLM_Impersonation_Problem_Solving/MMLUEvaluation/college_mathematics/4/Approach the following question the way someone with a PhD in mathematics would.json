    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "In order to determine the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 randomly selected suitcases are damaged, we can use the concept of combinations and the probability of independent events.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25, which can be done using combinations. This can be expressed as \"25 choose 3\", which is calculated as C(25, 3) = 25! / (3!(25-3)!) = 2300.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of ways to select exactly 2 out of the 5 damaged suitcases and 1 out of the 20 undamaged suitcases. This can be expressed as \"5 choose 2\" * \"20 choose 1\", which is calculated as C(5, 2) * C(20, 1) = (5!/(2!(5-2)!)) * (20!/(1!(20-1)!)) = 10 * 20 = 200.\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 3 selected suitcases is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, which is 200/2300 = 2/23.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2/23.",
