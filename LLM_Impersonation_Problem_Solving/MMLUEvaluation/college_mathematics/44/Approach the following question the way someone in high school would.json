    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the number 7^25, we can start by looking for a pattern in the units digits of the powers of 7. \n\nWhen we look at the units digits of the first few powers of 7: 7^1 = 7, 7^2 = 49, 7^3 = 343, 7^4 = 2401, and so on.\n\nWe notice that the units digit pattern repeats every 4 powers of 7. So, if we divide the exponent 25 by 4, we get a remainder of 1. This means the units digit in the number 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 7.",
