    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of 7^25, we can consider the patterns of the units digits of powers of 7:\n\n7^1 = 7\n7^2 = 49\n7^3 = 343\n7^4 = 2401\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the units digits of powers of 7 cycle in the pattern 7, 9, 3, 1. Therefore, the units digit of 7^25 will be the same as the units digit of 7^1, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 7",
