    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's think about the number 7 raised to the power of 25. That means we multiply 7 by itself 25 times. Let's just focus on the units digit, which is the digit all the way to the right. When you multiply 7 by 7, the units digit is 9. When you multiply 9 by 7, the units digit is 3. When you multiply 3 by 7, the units digit is 1. And it keeps going in a pattern: 7, 9, 3, 1. So the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of 7^25 is 7, which is answer choice D.",
