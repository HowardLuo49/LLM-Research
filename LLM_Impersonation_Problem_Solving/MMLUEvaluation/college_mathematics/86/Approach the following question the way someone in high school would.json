Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",

    "gpt_response": "This question is asking us which condition is not equivalent to any of the other conditions. So let's think about each condition:\n\nA: This means that any two distinct columns of M are linearly independent, which means they are not multiples of each other. This could also be related to the determinant of M being nonzero.\n\nB: This means that the only solution to the homogeneous system Mx = 0 is the trivial solution (where all entries of x are 0). This could also be related to the determinant of M being nonzero.\n\nC: This means that the system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for any real column vector b. This could also be related to the determinant of M being nonzero.\n\nD: This means that the determinant of M is nonzero, which implies that M is invertible.\n\nBased on this, it seems like condition D (the determinant of M is nonzero) is not equivalent to any of the other conditions.",
