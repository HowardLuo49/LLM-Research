Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",

Let's see which ones go together.\n\nCondition A says that if we pick two different column vectors from M, they will always be linearly independent. This means they don't have a special relationship with each other that makes them dependent on each other.\n\nCondition B is about the system Mx = 0 having only one solution, which is a boring solution where all the components of x are zero.\n\nCondition C talks about the system Mx = b having a unique solution for any column vector b we pick. This means there is only one answer for each different b.\n\nCondition D is all about the determinant of our matrix M being nonzero. This means our matrix is special and can do special things.\n\nNow, we need to find the odd one out! Let's think about it together and match up the conditions that go together.
