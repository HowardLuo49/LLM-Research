Exactly four of the following five conditions on M are equivalent to each other. Which of the five conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four?\nA: For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent.\nB: The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution.\nC: The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\nD: The determinant of M is nonzero.",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's look at each condition one by one. \n\nCondition A is talking about column vectors being linearly independent, which means they are not just multiples of each other. \n\nCondition B is saying that the system of equations Mx = 0 only has one solution, which is the trivial one where all the variables are 0.\n\nCondition C is saying that for any real 5 x 1 column vector b, the system of equations Mx = b has just one solution.\n\nCondition D is talking about the determinant of the matrix M being nonzero, which means the matrix is invertible.\n\nCondition E doesn't really match any of the other conditions because it's not directly related to linear independence, unique solutions, or the determinant being nonzero.\n\nSo the answer is E: The determinant of M is nonzero.",
