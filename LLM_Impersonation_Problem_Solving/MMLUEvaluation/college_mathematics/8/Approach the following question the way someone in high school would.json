    "gpt_response": "I would approach this question by recalling the properties of linear transformations and their matrices. Since P^2 = P, we know that P is idempotent (meaning applying the linear transformation twice is the same as applying it once). \n\nFrom this information, we know that P cannot be invertible since idempotent matrices are never invertible (unless they are the identity matrix or the zero matrix). \n\nNext, we consider whether P is diagonalizable. Since P is idempotent, the only possible eigenvalues it can have are 0 and 1. If P has distinct eigenvalues (0 and 1), then it is diagonalizable. However, if P has repeated eigenvalues, then it may not be diagonalizable. Therefore, it is not always true that P is diagonalizable.\n\nLastly, we consider whether P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Since P is idempotent, the only possible eigenvalues are 0 and 1. Therefore, P must be the projection onto a subspace of V, where one subspace maps to 0 and the other subspace maps to itself. Thus, P is neither the identity transformation nor the zero transformation.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the statements must be true, so the answer is A: None.",
