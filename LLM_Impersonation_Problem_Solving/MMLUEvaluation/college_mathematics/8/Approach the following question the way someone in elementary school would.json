Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space and let P be a linear transformation of V such that P^2 = P. Which of the following must be true?\nI. P is invertible.\nII. P is diagonalizable.\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nA: None\nB: I only\nC: II only\nD: III only",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. So we have a linear transformation P on a real vector space V, and we know that P squared is equal to P. First, let's think about what it means for P to be invertible. In order for a linear transformation to be invertible, it must be bijective, meaning it has to have a unique inverse. In this case, since P squared is equal to P, it's possible for P to not have an inverse. So, that means option I is not always true.\n\nNext, let's think about diagonalizability. A matrix is diagonalizable if it's similar to a diagonal matrix, meaning it can be broken down into eigenvectors. In this case, just because P squared is equal to P does not necessarily mean it can be diagonalized. So, option II is not always true.\n\nNow, for option III, we have two possibilities: P could be the identity transformation (meaning it doesn't change any vector) or the zero transformation (meaning it sends every vector to the zero vector). This makes sense because P squared being equal to P can happen in both of these cases. So, option III is sometimes true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: III only.",
