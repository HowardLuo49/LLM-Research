    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\nI. P is invertible:\nIf P is invertible, then we can find a linear transformation Q such that PQ = QP = I (identity transformation). However, since P^2 = P, we have P(P-I) = 0. If P is invertible, then P-I = 0, which implies that P = I. Therefore, P is not necessarily invertible.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable:\nIf P is diagonalizable, then we can find a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of P. Since P is idempotent (P^2 = P), its only possible eigenvalues are 0 and 1. However, a linear transformation can be diagonalizable even if its only eigenvalues are 0 and 1 (consider the identity and zero transformations), so P is not necessarily diagonalizable.\n\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation:\nThis statement is true. Since P^2 = P, we have P(P-I) = 0, which means that the minimal polynomial of P divides the polynomial x(x-1). Therefore, the characteristic polynomial of P is either x or x(x-1). Thus, P is diagonalizable and its only possible eigenvalues are 0 and 1. A linear transformation with only eigenvalues 0 and 1 is either the zero transformation or the identity transformation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: III only.",
