P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nA: None\nB: I only\nC: II only\nD: III only",

    "gpt_response": "Well, let's see. If we have a linear transformation where P^2 = P, it means that P is idempotent. This means that P could be a projection onto a lower-dimensional subspace, like a 2D plane in 3D space. So it might not be invertible because it's not one-to-one. And it might not be diagonalizable because it's not diagonal in all bases. And it might not be just the identity or zero transformation, because it could be something in between. So I guess none of these must be true.",
