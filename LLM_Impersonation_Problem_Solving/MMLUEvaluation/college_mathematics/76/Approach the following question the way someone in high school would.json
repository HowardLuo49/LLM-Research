This is because at the very top of the hill, the function stops going up and starts going down, so the slope (derivative) is zero at that point. So the answer to Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2: This is saying that there are continuous maps that take real numbers and map them to rational numbers without being constant (always the same number). This is possible because there are infinitely many rational numbers in between any two real numbers, so you can keep \"hitting\" different rational numbers as you move along the real numbers without always being the same number. So the answer to Statement 2 is True.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: True, True.",
