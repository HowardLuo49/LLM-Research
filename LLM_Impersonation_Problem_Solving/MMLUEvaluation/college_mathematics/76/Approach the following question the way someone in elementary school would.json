So, I guess f'(x) would have to exist and equal 0 because at a maximum point, the slope of the function is flat. \n\nAnd for the second statement about maps from R to Q, I think that means there can be continuous maps from the real numbers to the rational numbers that aren't always the same number. So I think that's true too.\n\nSo, I would say the answer is A: True, True!",
