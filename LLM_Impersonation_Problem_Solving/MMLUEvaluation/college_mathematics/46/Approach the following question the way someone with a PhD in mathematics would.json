    "gpt_response": "To find the volume of the resulting solid of revolution, we need to set up an integral to calculate the volume using the method of cylindrical shells. \n\nFirst, we need to find the points of intersection between the two curves y = x and y = x^2 in the first quadrant. This can be done by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\nx = x^2\n\nRearranging gives:\n\nx^2 - x = 0\n\nFactoring out an x gives:\n\nx(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the points of intersection are at x = 0 and x = 1.\n\nNext, we choose a representative radius r(x) for the cylindrical shell. Since we are revolving around the y-axis, the radius will be x. The height of the shell will be the difference in y-values between the two curves, so the height will be x - x^2.\n\nFinally, we set up the integral:\n\nV = \u222b[0,1] 2\u03c0x(x - x^2) dx\n\nV = 2\u03c0\u222b[0,1] (x^2 - x^3) dx\n\nV = 2\u03c0 [1/3 * x^3 - 1/4 * x^4]\u2223[0,1]\n\nV = 2\u03c0 [1/3 - 1/4]\n\nV = 2\u03c0 [4/12 - 3/12]\n\nV = 2\u03c0/12\n\nThus, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is \u03c0/6, which corresponds to option B.",
