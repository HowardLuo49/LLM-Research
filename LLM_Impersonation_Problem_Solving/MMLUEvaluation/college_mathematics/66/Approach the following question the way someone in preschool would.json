To find the minimum value of the expression, we need to find the smallest possible value that x + 4z can be while still following this rule.\n\nLet's think about this in simpler terms. If we have a number line with values for x and z, we want to find the smallest possible number when we add x and 4z together. \n\nSince the constraint is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2, it means that x, y, and z can be between -1 and 1. If we chose x = -1 and z = -1, then x + 4z would equal -5, which is smaller than our constraint.\n\nThus, the minimum value for x + 4z would be -5, but since that's not an option, the closest answer choice is B: -2.",
