We know that x and z can take on any real numbers in R^3. \n\nNext, we have the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2. This means that the sum of the squares of x, y, and z cannot exceed 2. \n\nTo find the minimum value of x + 4z, we can rewrite the expression x + 4z as x + 0y + 4z. This helps us see that the value of y does not affect the minimum value of the expression.\n\nSince we want to minimize x + 4z while ensuring x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2, we should minimize x and maximize z. \n\nLet's set x = -sqrt(2) and z = sqrt(2). Plugging these values into the expression x + 4z, we get -sqrt(2) + 4sqrt(2) = 3sqrt(2). \n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z subject to the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2 is D: -sqrt(35).",
