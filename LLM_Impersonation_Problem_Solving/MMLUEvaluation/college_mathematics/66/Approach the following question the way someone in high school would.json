    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z, we first need to understand the constraint x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2. This is the equation of a sphere with radius sqrt(2) centered at the origin in 3D space.\n\nTo minimize x + 4z, we need to find the point on this sphere where this expression is the smallest. Since x + 4z can be written as (x, y, z) \u2022 (1, 0, 4), the minimum value of x + 4z will occur when the two vectors are parallel. This means that the gradient of x + 4z must be perpendicular to the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe gradient of x + 4z is (1, 0, 4) and the gradient of x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2x, 2y, 2z. \n\nSetting these two gradients as parallel gives the system of equations:\n1 = 2x\u03bb\n0 = 2y\u03bb\n4 = 2z\u03bb\n\nFrom the first and third equations, we see that \u03bb = 1/2. Substituting back into the second equation, we get 0 = 0. This means that there is no restriction on y and we can set y = 0.\n\nFrom x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2, substituting y = 0 gives x^2 + z^2 = 2. From the point we found, x = \u00b1\u221a2 and z = 0.\n\nNow substituting x = \u00b1\u221a2 and z = 0 into x + 4z gives us -\u221a2 + 0 = -\u221a2 and \u221a2 + 0 = \u221a2, respectively. The smallest value is -\u221a2.\nTherefore, the answer is C: -sqrt(2).",
