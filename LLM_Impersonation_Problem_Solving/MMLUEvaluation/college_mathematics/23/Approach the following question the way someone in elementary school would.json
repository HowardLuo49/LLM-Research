A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Oh wow, this is a tricky question! Let's try to figure it out together. Since the die is counterfeit and the probability of rolling an even number is twice the probability of rolling an odd number, that means there must be more even numbers on the die than odd numbers.\n\nSo let's look at the even numbers first. There are three even numbers on a regular die (2, 4, 6). If the probability of rolling an even number is twice the probability of rolling an odd number, that must mean there are three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) on the die. \n\nNow, we have to find the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6. Since there is only one 5 on the die and one 6, the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 6 would be 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9.\n\nSo the answer is D: 1/9.",
