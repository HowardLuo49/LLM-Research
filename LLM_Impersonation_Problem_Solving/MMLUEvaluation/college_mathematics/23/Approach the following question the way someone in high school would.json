A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?\nA: 2/81\nB: 1/18\nC: 2/27\nD: 1/9",
    "solution": "A",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so first let's remember that there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) on a regular die. Since the counterfeit die has twice the probability of rolling an even number compared to an odd number, that means the probability of rolling an even number is 2/3 and the probability of rolling an odd number is 1/3.\n\nNow we want to find the probability of rolling a 5 first and then a 6. The probability of rolling a 5 is 1/6 (since there is only one 5 on a die) and the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6 as well.\n\nTo find the probability of both events happening, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36.\n\nBut wait, we need to multiply this probability by 2 because the probability of rolling an odd number (in this case, a 5) is actually 2 times less likely than rolling an even number with the counterfeit die. So, 1/36 x 2 = 2/36 = 1/18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 1/18.",
