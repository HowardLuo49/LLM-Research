S(n) is a statement about positive integers n such that whenever S(k) is true, S(k + 1) must also be true. Furthermore, there exists some positive integer n0 such that S(n0) is not true. Of the following, which is the strongest conclusion that can be drawn?\nA: S(n0 + 1) is not true.\nB: S(n0 - 1) is not true.\nC: S(n) is not true for any n <= n0\nD: S(n) is not true for any n >= n0",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that S(n) is true for some positive integers n but not for n0. We also know that if S(k) is true, then S(k + 1) is also true. The strongest conclusion we can draw from this is:\n\nC: S(n) is not true for any n <= n0.\n\nThis means that for any positive integer smaller than or equal to n0, S(n) will not be true.",
