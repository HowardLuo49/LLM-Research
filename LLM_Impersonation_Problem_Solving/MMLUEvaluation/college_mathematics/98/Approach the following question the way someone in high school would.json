X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, to start off let's think about how many subsets of X contain exactly 2 elements. Well, that's just choosing 2 elements out of however many elements are in X. So that's nCr, where n is the number of elements in X and r is 2. \n\nNext, let's think about how many subsets of X contain exactly 3 elements. That's nCr again, but this time r is 3. \n\nThe problem tells us that the number of subsets with 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets with 2 elements. So we can write an equation:\n\nnCr(3) = nCr(2) + 14\n\nNow, let's solve that equation to find the number of elements in X. Once we know that, we can find the number of subsets with 4 elements by using nCr(4). \n\nSo I think the answer is 28, which is option C.",
