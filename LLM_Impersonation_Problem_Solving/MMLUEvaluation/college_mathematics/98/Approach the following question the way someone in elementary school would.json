X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Ok, so let's break this down. We know that there are 14 more subsets with 3 elements than 2 elements. That means there are 14 subsets with 3 elements.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many total subsets there are. We know that a set with n elements has 2^n subsets. So if there are 14 subsets with 3 elements, that means there are 2^3=8 subsets with 2 elements. \n\nSo in total, there are 14 + 8 = 22 subsets of X. \n\nSince we know there are 22 subsets, and we already found there are subsets with 2 and 3 elements. We can figure out the number of subsets with 4 elements by subtracting those from the total. \n\nSo 22 - 8 - 14 = 0 subsets with 4 elements. \n\nTherefore, the answer is  A: 24, because there are no subsets with 4 elements.",
