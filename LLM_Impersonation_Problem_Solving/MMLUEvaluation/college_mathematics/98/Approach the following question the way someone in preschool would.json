X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements. How many subsets of X contain exactly 4 elements?\nA: 24\nB: 25\nC: 28\nD: 35",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm.. let's count the numbers of sets with 2 and 3 elements first. Then we can figure out how many sets have 4 elements.\n\n2-element sets: 14\n\n3-element sets: 14 + 14 = 28\n\nNow, we want to find out the number of sets with 4 elements. Since each element can either be in or out of a set, we can use the formula 2^n where n is the number of elements.\n\n2^4 = 16\n\nBut we have to subtract 1 because we can't have an empty set.\n\n16 - 1 = 15\n\nSo the answer is not in the options. Oh no! Let's try again.\n\nHmm.. let's try another way.\n\nSince there are 4 elements, we can choose 4 elements out of X to make a set.\n\n4 choose 4 = 1\n\nNow we have to consider all the possible combinations of elements in X.\n\nSo the answer is not in the options again.
