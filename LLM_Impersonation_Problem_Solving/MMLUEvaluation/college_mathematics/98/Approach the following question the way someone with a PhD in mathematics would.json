X is a finite set with the following property: The number of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements.

    "gpt_response": "Let X be a finite set with n elements. \n\nLet A be the set of subsets of X that contain exactly 2 elements, and let B be the set of subsets of X that contain exactly 3 elements. \n\nLet A' be the cardinality of set A, and let B' be the cardinality of set B. \n\nAccording to the given information, we have B' = A' + 14. \n\nWe know that the cardinality of A is given by n choose 2, which is n!/(2!(n-2)!). \n\nSimilarly, the cardinality of B is given by n choose 3, which is n!/(3!(n-3)!). \n\nSince B' = A' + 14, we have n!/(3!(n-3)!) = n!/(2!(n-2)!) + 14. \n\nSolving this equation, we find that n = 7. \n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements is given by 7 choose 4, which is 7!/(4!(7-4)!) = 35. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 35.",
