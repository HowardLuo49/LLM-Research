    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "The answer to this question is D: 45. In a complete graph, each of the vertices is connected to every other vertex, so to find the number of edges in a complete graph with 10 vertices, you can use the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. So in this case, 10(10-1)/2 = 45.",
