    "gpt_response": "To find out how many edges are in a complete graph with 10 vertices, we can think of it as connecting each vertex with every other vertex. So, if we have 10 vertices, we just need to count how many pairs of vertices there are and that will tell us how many edges there are. \n\nLet's start with the first vertex. It can be connected to all other 9 vertices. Then, we move to the next vertex and connect it to the remaining 8 vertices. We continue this for each vertex until we reach the last one. \n\nTo make it easier, let's imagine each vertex is a person and we want to connect each person with every other person. As we go from person to person, we see that we need to form a line connecting them. So, for 10 people, we need to form lines between all of them.\n\nSo, the answer is D: 45.",
