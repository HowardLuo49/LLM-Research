A: When we add any two numbers from our special group, we get a number in our special group, so that's true. B: When we multiply any two numbers from our special group, we get a number in our special group, so that's true. C: When we add any number from our special group to another number, we get that same number back, so that's true. D: When we multiply any number from our special group by another number, we might not get a number in our special group, so that's false. So, the false statement is D!",
