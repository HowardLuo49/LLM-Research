    "gpt_response": "Ok, so we need to find the length of the curve given by the parametric equations x = cos t and y = sin t. First, we know that the curve is traced out as t goes from 0 to pi.\n\nTo find the length of the curve, we can use the formula for arc length: L = \u222b [sqrt(dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2] dt.\n\nIn this case, dx/dt = -sin t and dy/dt = cos t, so the formula simplifies to L = \u222b [sqrt((-sin t)^2 + (cos t)^2)] dt.\n\nEvaluating the integral over the interval [0, pi], we get L = \u222b [sqrt(1)] dt = \u222b dt = t [from 0 to pi] = pi.\n\nTherefore, the length of the curve is pi. So, the answer is B: pi.",
