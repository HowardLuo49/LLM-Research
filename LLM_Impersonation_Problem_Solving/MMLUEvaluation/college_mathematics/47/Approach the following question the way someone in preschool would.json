    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's imagine there is a little bug walking along a curvy path in the xy-plane. The bug is going around a circle! The x-coordinate of the bug is the cosine of t and the y-coordinate is the sine of t. When t is between 0 and pi, the bug is walking halfway around the circle. So, the length of the curve that the bug walks is half the circumference of the circle. The circumference of a circle is 2 times pi times the radius, and since the radius is 1, the circumference is 2pi. So, our bug walks half of that distance, which is pi. So the answer is B: pi. Yay bug!",
