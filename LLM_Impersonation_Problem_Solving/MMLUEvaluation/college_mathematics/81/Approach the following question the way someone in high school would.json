    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we know that f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]. This means that f(2) = 1^2 + f(0). But since the graph passes through the origin, we know that f(0) = 0. So f(2) = 1^2 + f(0) = 1.\n\nNow, let's find f(4). We use the formula f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)] again. \nf(4) = 2^2 + f[2(4 - 1)] = 4 + f(6). \n\nWe can't solve for f(6) yet because we need to find f(5) first:\nf(5) = 2^2 + f[2(5 - 1)] = 4 + f(8). \n\nNow we know f(5) = 4 + f(8). We can substitute this into the previous equation to solve for f(4):\nf(4) = 4 + f[2(4 - 1)] = 4 + f(5) = 4 + 4 + f(8) = 8 + f(8). \n\nWe're almost there, we just need to find f(8). \nf(8) = 3^2 + f[2(8-1)] = 9 + f(14). \n\nNow we need to find f(14) to be able to go back and find f(8). And it keeps going this way until we reach our final answer.\n\nSo, it looks like we've made a mistake somewhere. Let's try another approach. Let's write out the equation for f(8) directly.\n\nf(8) = 4^2 + f[2(8 - 1)] = 16 + f(14)\n\nHmmm.. So it seems we're lacking information to solve this. Let's reconsider our approach. Maybe we missed something in the initial equation. Let's go back and take another look at f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)].\n\nAfter reevaluating, it looks like we can rewrite the equation f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)] as:\nf(2n) = n^2 + f(2(n - 1))\n\nNow we can substitute n = 4 into the equation:\nf(8) = 4^2 + f(2(4 - 1)) = 16 + f(6)\n\nAnd continuing this process:\nf(6) = 3^2 + f(2(3 - 1)) = 9 + f(4)\nf(4) = 2^2 + f(2(2 - 1)) = 4 + f(2)\nf(2) = 1^2 + f(2(1 - 1)) = 1 + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nNow we can backtrack to find f(4):\nf(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nAnd finally, our answer is f(8):\nf(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 9 + f(4) = 16 + 9 + 5 = 30\n\nSo, the answer is B: 30.",
