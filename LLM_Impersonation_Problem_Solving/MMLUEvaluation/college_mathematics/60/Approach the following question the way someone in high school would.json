    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of real roots, we can use Descartes' rule of signs. The rule states that the number of positive real roots of a polynomial is equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial, or is less than that by an even number. In this case, the polynomial is 2x^5 + 8x - 7. The coefficients are 2, 8, and -7. There is only one sign change in the coefficients of the polynomial, so there is only one positive real root.\n\nCounting the negative roots can be found by replacing x with -x and simplifying the polynomial. In this case, the new polynomial is 2(-x)^5 + 8(-x) - 7, which simplifies to -2x^5 - 8x - 7. There are two sign changes, so there are two or zero negative roots. Since there are no sign changes between consecutive terms, there are zero negative roots.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7 has one real root. Thus, the answer is B: One.",
