    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of real roots of the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7, we can analyze the end behavior. As x approaches negative infinity, the leading term dominates and the polynomial approaches negative infinity. As x approaches positive infinity, the leading term also dominates and the polynomial approaches positive infinity. Since the polynomial is of odd degree, it must cross the x-axis at least once. Therefore, the polynomial has at least one real root.\n\nHowever, to determine the exact number of real roots, we can also analyze the intervals where the polynomial changes sign. By applying the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can evaluate the value of the polynomial at specific points and determine if there is a root in that interval. By calculating the values of the polynomial at different points and analyzing the sign changes, we can determine that the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7 has one real root.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: One.",
