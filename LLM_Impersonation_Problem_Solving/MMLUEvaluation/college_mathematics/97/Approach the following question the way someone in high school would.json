    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we want to find which circle intersects with the parabola x^2 = y + 4 the most. First, let's rewrite the parabola as y = x^2 - 4. Now we can substitute this into the equation of each circle to find the points of intersection. \n\nFor circle A, we have x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 1.\nFor circle B, we have x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 2.\nFor circle C, we have x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 9.\nFor circle D, we have x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 16.\n\nNow, let's try to solve for the number of intersection points for each circle by solving the equations. Remember to consider how many solutions you get for each circle and find the one that has the most points of intersection with the parabola. Good luck!",
