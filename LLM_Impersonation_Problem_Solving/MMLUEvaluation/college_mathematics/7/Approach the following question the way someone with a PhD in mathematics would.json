    "gpt_response": "To determine the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle, we need to consider the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's assume that point A is chosen at random, and then point B is chosen at random from the segment between 0 and 10 (where point A is located at 0 and point B is located at 10).\n\nIf the length of the segment AB is less than 5, then two of the smaller segments will definitely be shorter than the remaining segment, and hence they cannot form a triangle. Similarly, if the length of segment AB is greater than 5, then one of the smaller segments will be longer than the sum of the other two, and they cannot form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the three smaller segments to form the sides of a triangle is if the length of segment AB is between 5 and 10.
