Points A and B are chosen randomly such that A and B divide the segment into three smaller segments. What is the probability that the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle?\nA: 0\nB: 10%\nC: 25%\nD: 50%",
    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so if the segment is divided into three parts, we need to check if any three parts can make a triangle. To make a triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides must be greater than the length of the longest side. Since the segment is 10 units long, the longest side can be a maximum of 10 units. So, if the two shorter sides add up to more than 10 units, they can't make a triangle. That means there's NO chance of making a triangle. So, the answer is A: 0.",
