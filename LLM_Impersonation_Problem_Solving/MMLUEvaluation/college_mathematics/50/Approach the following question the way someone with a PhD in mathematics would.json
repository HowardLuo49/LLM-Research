    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we first need to understand the properties of the given equation x^(log y) = y^log x. \n\nLet's consider the equation as f(x, y) = x^(log y) - y^log x = 0. To determine the nature of the solution set, we need to analyze the behavior of this function.\n\nIn the xy-plane, the graph of the equation x^(log y) = y^log x represents the set of points that satisfy the equation. Since the equation involves logarithmic functions, we can consider taking logarithms on both sides to simplify the expression.\n\nBy taking the natural log of both sides, we have:\n\nlog(x^(log y)) = log(y^log x)\nlog y * log x = log x * log y\nlog y = log y\n\nThis indicates that the equation is satisfied for all real values of x and y.
