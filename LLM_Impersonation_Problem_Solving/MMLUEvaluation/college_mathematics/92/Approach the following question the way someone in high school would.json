    "gpt_response": "So let's think about this problem. We have to find the probability that x is less than y when x is chosen randomly between 0 and 3 and y is chosen randomly between 0 and 4. \n\nFirst let's think about the possible outcomes. The total area in the rectangle formed by x and y is 3*4=12. \n\nNow let's consider the area where x < y. We can think about this as the area under the line y=x in the rectangle. This area is a right-angled triangle with base 3 and height 4. So the area is 1/2 * 3 * 4 = 6. \n\nTherefore, the probability that x < y is 6/12 = 1/2. \n\nSo the answer is A: 1/2.",
