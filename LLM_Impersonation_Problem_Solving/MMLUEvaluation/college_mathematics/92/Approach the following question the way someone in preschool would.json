    "gpt_response": "Okay, so we have to pick a number between 0 and 3 for x, and a number between 0 and 4 for y. If we draw a line starting at 0 and going to 3 for x, and another line starting at 0 and going to 4 for y, we can see that there are some points where x is less than y. So, we count the number of points where x is less than y, and we see that there are 6 out of 9 points where x < y. So the answer is 6/9, which simplifies to 2/3. So, the answer is D: 2/3.",
