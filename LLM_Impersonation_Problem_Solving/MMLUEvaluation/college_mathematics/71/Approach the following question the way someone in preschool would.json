    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "It seems like you are trying to determine if statement D is true or false based on the information provided. \n\nStatement D says that every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). In other words, all solutions can be obtained by multiplying (-5, 1, 1, 0) by a scalar (a number). \n\nTo determine if this is true, you can try to solve the equations given and see if every solution matches this pattern. If all solutions can indeed be obtained by multiplying (-5, 1, 1, 0) by a scalar, then statement D is true. If not, then statement D is false.\n\nIt might be helpful to go through the equations provided and try to solve for the unknown variables to see if they follow the pattern described in statement D.",
