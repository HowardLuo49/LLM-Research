If we have two numbers a and b in our group, and when we square their product (ab)^2 it's the same as squaring each number individually (a^2b^2), then maybe our group is like a little circle where each number connects to another number. And if we keep going around the circle, we end up back at the beginning. So maybe our group is cyclic and it goes around and around like a fun merry-go-round! Yay!
