So, there are 7 choices where they won't choose a pair where one is the square of the other.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 7/10 or 0.7 in decimal form.\n\nSince none of the given options match 0.7, we can see that our answer is not listed.",
