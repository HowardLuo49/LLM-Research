    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay so we need to find the point on the plane that is closest to the origin. The plane equation is 2x + y + 3z = 3. To find the point closest to the origin, we need to find the point where the perpendicular distance from the point to the origin is the smallest.\n\nFirst, let's turn the plane into a vector form. The normal vector of the plane is (2, 1, 3). This normal vector is perpendicular to the plane. Let the point on the plane closest to the origin be (a, b, c). \n\nThe vector from the origin to this point is (a, b, c). The projection of this vector onto the normal vector should be zero for the point to be on the plane and also the closest to the origin.\n\nSo, (a, b, c) dot (2, 1, 3) = 0.\n\n2a + b + 3c = 0.\n\nNow, we also know that the point lies on the plane, so 2a + b + 3c = 3.\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we find that the point with the coordinates (7/15, 8/15, 1/15) is the closest to the origin. So the answer is C: (7/15, 8/15, 1/15).",
