That means we need to find the point where the distance from the origin is the smallest.\n\nTo find the point on the plane that is closest to the origin, we can rewrite the equation of the plane as a function of distance from the origin. The distance from a point (x, y, z) to the origin (0, 0, 0) is given by the formula sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2).\n\nSo we need to minimize the function sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) subject to the constraint 2x + y + 3z = 3. This is a bit tricky, but for now, let's focus on finding the point on the plane.\n\nBy solving the equation 2x + y + 3z = 3, we can find the coordinates of the point on the plane. \nOne way to do this could be to set one variable as a parameter and express the other variables in terms of that parameter. However, since we are in elementary school, let\u2019s focus on the answer choices that were given to us.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that the point on the plane closest to the origin is actually on the plane itself.
