In a game two players take turns tossing a fair coin; the winner is the first one to toss a head. The probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is\nA: 1/4\nB: 1/3\nC: 1/2\nD: 2/3",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To analyze the probability of winning the game for the player who makes the first toss, let's denote the probability of winning for the player who makes the first toss as P. \n\nIf the player who makes the first toss gets a head on the first toss, they win the game with probability 1. \n\nIf the player who makes the first toss gets a tail on the first toss, then it is as if the roles are reversed, and the other player now has the same situation as the first player - namely, they are now the player who makes the first toss. Therefore, the probability of winning in this case is 1 - P. \n\nSo overall, the probability of winning for the player who makes the first toss can be expressed as:\n\nP = 1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * (1 - P)\nP = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2*P\nP = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/2*P\n3/2*P = 1\nP = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is 2/3. \n\nSo the correct answer is D: 2/3.",
