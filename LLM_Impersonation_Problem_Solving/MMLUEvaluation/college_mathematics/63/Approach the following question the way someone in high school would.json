    "gpt_response": "Hmm, okay let's think about this. So if the first player wins, they must get heads on their first toss. That means the probability of that happening is 1/2, right? And if the first player doesn't win on their first toss, then the second player gets a chance. So the probability that the second player wins is also 1/2. \n\nBut wait, doesn't that mean that the first player has a 1/2 chance and the second player has a 1/2 chance? So the probability that the first player wins should be 1/2, right? \n\nSo I think the answer is C: 1/2. Wow, math can be confusing sometimes!",
