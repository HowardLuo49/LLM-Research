    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's break this down. The null space of D consists of all polynomials in P that satisfy D(p(x)) = 0, which means they have a derivative of 0. Since the derivative of a polynomial of degree less than or equal to 7 is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to 6, there is only one polynomial of degree less than or equal to 6 whose derivative is 0, and that's the constant polynomial. So the dimension of the null space is 1.\n\nThe range of D consists of all possible derivatives of polynomials in P. Since the derivative of a polynomial of degree less than or equal to 7 is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to 6, the range of D is essentially all polynomials in P of degree less than or equal to 6 (since some of the higher degree polynomials might not be reached by differentiation). There are a total of 7 degrees of polynomials in P (0 to 7), so the dimension of the range is 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) n = 1 and r = 7.",
