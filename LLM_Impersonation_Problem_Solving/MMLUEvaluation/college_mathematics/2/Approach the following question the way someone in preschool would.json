But wait, what does null space and range mean? Well, the null space is all the polynomials that get sent to zero by D, and the range is all the possible derivatives we can get.\n\nNow, let's think about it in terms of preschool! Imagine you have a box of colorful blocks (our polynomials) and you have an operator that takes out some blocks and puts in some new ones (D taking the derivative). The null space would be the blocks that don't change color, and the range would be all the different colors you can get.\n\nSo, if we have polynomials in Z_5 with degree less than or equal to 7, what would be the dimensions of the null space and range of D? Let's count our blocks and see! \n\nA: n = 1 (1 block that doesn't change color) and r = 6 (6 different colors we can get)\nB: n = 1 and r = 7\nC: n = 2 (2 blocks that don't change color) and r = 5 (5 different colors we can get)\nD: n = 2 and r = 6\n\nSince we want the null space and range of D, we can see that the correct answer is D: n = 2 and r = 6.
