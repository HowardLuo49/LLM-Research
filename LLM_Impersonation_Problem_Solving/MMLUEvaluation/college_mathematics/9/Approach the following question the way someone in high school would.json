So I don't think A is true.\n\nB: Every complete space is compact - If every Cauchy sequence converges, that doesn't necessarily mean that every open cover has a finite subcover. So I don't think B is true either.\n\nC: Neither (a) nor (b) - Based on what we just talked about, it seems like neither A nor B is true.
