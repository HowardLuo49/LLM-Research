    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's remember what an equilateral triangle is - it's a triangle where all three sides are the same length.\n\nNow, let's think about the inscribed circle. This means that the circle is inside the triangle and it touches all three sides of the triangle. The radius of the circle is 2.\n\nTo find the area of the triangle, we need to use the formula: Area = (side length squared * square root of 3) / 4. \n\nSince the radius of the circle is 2, that means the side length of the triangle is 4. \n\nNow we can plug in the side length into the formula:\n\nArea = (4 squared * square root of 3) / 4\nArea = (16 * square root of 3) / 4\nArea = 4 * square root of 3\n\nSo, the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has radius 2 is C: 12 * square root of 3.",
