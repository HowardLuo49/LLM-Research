    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem like a high schooler, we first need to remember the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle. The formula is (s^2 * sqrt(3))/4, where s is the length of one side of the triangle.\n\nNext, we need to find the side length of the equilateral triangle. The radius of the inscribed circle is 2, so the side length of the triangle is 2 units longer than the radius. Therefore, the side length is 4.\n\nNow, plug the side length into the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\n(4^2 * sqrt(3))/4 = 16 * sqrt(3) = 16 * sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 16 * sqrt(3), which corresponds to option D. So, the answer is D: 16*sqrt(3).",
