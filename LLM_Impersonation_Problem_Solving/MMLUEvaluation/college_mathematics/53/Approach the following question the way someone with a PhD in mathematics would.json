    "gpt_response": "To find the area of an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle with radius 2, we can first calculate the side length of the equilateral triangle using the radius of the inscribed circle.\n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle is also the height of the equilateral triangle. Since an equilateral triangle is made up of three congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, we can determine that the height is equal to the radius times the square root of 3.\n\nSo, the height of the equilateral triangle is 2(sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle (Area = (side length)^2 * sqrt(3) / 4), we can solve for the side length:\n\nArea = (side length)^2 * sqrt(3) / 4\n\nArea = (2(sqrt(3)))^2 * sqrt(3) / 4\nArea = 12(sqrt(3))\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12*sqrt(3).
