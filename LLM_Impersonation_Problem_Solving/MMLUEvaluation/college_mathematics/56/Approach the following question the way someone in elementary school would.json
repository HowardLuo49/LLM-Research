Let V be the vector space, under the usual operations, of real polynomials that are of degree at most 3. Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Then dim V + dim W is\nA: 4\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 7",

    "gpt_response": "First, let's think about what a vector space is. A vector space is a collection of objects (vectors) that you can add together and multiply by scalars. In this case, our vectors are polynomials. \n\nNow, for V, we have all real polynomials that are of degree at most 3. This means we can have polynomials like 3x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 5, but not polynomials like 4x^4 + 2x^3 - x^2.\n\nNext, let's look at W, which is the subspace of V where p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This means the polynomial must equal 0 when x is 0, 1, and -1. \n\nTo find dim V + dim W, we need to figure out the dimensions of V and W separately first. The dimension of V is the highest degree of polynomial we can have, which is 3. So dim V = 4.\n\nFor W, let's think about the restrictions we have. We need p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This means we have 3 restrictions on our polynomial. If we think about it, these restrictions are like reducing the degree of our polynomial by 3. So in W, the highest degree we can have is 0. This means dim W = 1.\n\nNow, we can add dim V and dim W together to get the answer. dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5. Therefore, the answer is B: 5.",
