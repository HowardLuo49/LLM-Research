Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Then dim V + dim W is\nA: 4\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 7",

    "gpt_response": "To find the dimension of a vector space, we need to determine how many linearly independent vectors form a basis for that space. In this case, we are working with real polynomials of degree at most 3.\n\nFor the vector space V, the basis can be chosen as {1, x, x^2, x^3}, since any polynomial of degree at most 3 can be written as a linear combination of these four polynomials.\n\nNow, let's consider the subspace W. We are looking for polynomials such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. This means the polynomials in W must satisfy these three conditions. Let's say p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d is a polynomial in W. Then we have:\np(0) = d = 0\np(1) = a + b + c + d = 0\np(-1) = -a + b - c + d = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, we already know that d = 0. Substituting d = 0 into the other two equations, we get:\na + b + c = 0\n-a + b - c = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we find that a = c = 0 and b = 0. So, the polynomials in W would be of the form kx(x-1)(x+1), where k is a constant.\n\nThe basis for W would be {x(x-1)(x+1)}. \n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W is 4 (for V) + 1 (for W) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: B) 5.",
