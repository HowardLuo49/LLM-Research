Let W be the subspace of all polynomials p (x) in V such that p (0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. Then dim V + dim W is\nA: 4\nB: 5\nC: 6\nD: 7",

    "gpt_response": "Hmm let's see, V is like a big bag of polynomials with degree at most 3. And W is like a special bag of polynomials that have some rules to follow. \n\nSo, if we count how many different kinds of polynomials we can have in V, that's like counting how many different toys we can have in a toy box. And then if we count how many polynomials we can have in W, that's like counting how many of those toys have to follow special rules.\n\nWhen we add up the number of toys in the toy box (V) and the number of toys in the special bag (W), we get the total number of toys we have. And that's our answer!\n\nLet's count together: we have 4 different ways to pick the degree of the polynomial (0, 1, 2, or 3), so dim V is 4. And for dim W, we have 3 extra rules that the polynomial has to follow, so that's 3 less choices. That means dim W is 1.\n\nNow when we add dim V (4) and dim W (1), we get 5 toys in total! So the answer is B: 5. Yay, we did it!",
