This is a fair split, so it's not more likely than the others.\n\nB: Getting 60 or more tails means we would get 40 or fewer heads, which is a lot scarcer than getting between 51 and 55 heads, so this is more likely than option A.\n\nC: Getting between 51 and 55 heads means getting between 45 and 49 tails, which is more likely than getting exactly 50 of each. This is the most likely option out of the ones given.\n\nD: Getting at least 48 heads and 48 tails means a pretty even split, but not as likely as getting between 51 and 55 heads, which is our best choice. \n\nSo, option C: 51 <= H <= 55 has the greatest probability!",
