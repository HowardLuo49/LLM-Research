    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many positive numbers x satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x, we need to utilize the properties of cosine functions.\n\nSince cosine functions oscillate between -1 and 1, the value of x must also lie between -1 and 1. Thus, we can narrow down our search space to the interval [-1,1]. \n\nNext, we need to consider the behavior of the cosine function. Since the period of a cosine function is 2\u03c0, we need to find the number of complete cycles within the interval [-1,1]. In this case, the period of the function is 2\u03c0/97.\n\nSince the period of the cosine function is less than 1, the function cos(97x) will have multiple intersections with the line y=x within the interval [-1,1]. \n\nBy carefully analyzing the function and its periodicity, we can determine that only 1 positive number x satisfies the equation cos(97x) = x.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.",
