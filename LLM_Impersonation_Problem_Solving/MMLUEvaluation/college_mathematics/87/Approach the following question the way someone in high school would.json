    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Since there are multiple x values, the answer is not 1. To find the number of positive solutions, we can graph y = cos(97x) and y = x, and see how many times the graphs intersect in the first quadrant. By testing values or using a graphing calculator, we find that there are 15 intersections in the first quadrant. Therefore, the answer is B: 15.",
