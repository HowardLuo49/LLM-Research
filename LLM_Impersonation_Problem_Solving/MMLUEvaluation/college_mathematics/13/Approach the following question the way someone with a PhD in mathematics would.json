    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A large class is to be divided into teams and each student must be a member of exactly one team. However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Let's approach this question systematically. Let's denote the number of students as n. Each student dislikes 3 classmates, so this means that each student will be on a team with n-3 students that they do not dislike.\n\nWe can construct teams by having each student choose n-3 students they do not dislike. Each student has n-3 choices for teammates. This results in a total of (n-3)^(n) possible team configurations.\n\nNow, let's think about the constraint that no student can be on a team with someone they dislike. This means that for each student, their teammates must be chosen from the remaining n-3 students. Therefore, we have (n-3)! ways in which we can arrange the teams so that no student is on a team with someone they dislike.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to construct teams such that no student is on a team with someone they dislike is given by the number of possible team configurations divided by the number of arrangements where no student is on a team with someone they dislike:\n\n(n-3)^(n) / (n-3)!\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest n such that the above expression is an integer. It can be shown that the smallest n that satisfies this condition is n=10. Therefore, the answer is C: 10 teams.",
