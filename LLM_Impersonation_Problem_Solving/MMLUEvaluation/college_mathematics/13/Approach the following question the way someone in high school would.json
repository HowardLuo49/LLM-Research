However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",
    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "Okay, so each student dislikes three of their classmates. That means they can't be on the same team as those three people. So let's say we have a student, and they can't be on a team with A, B, and C. That means they have to be on a team with D, E, F, and so on. \n\nSo if we have 4 students who dislike each other, they can all be on different teams. That would mean we need 4 teams in total. So the answer is A: 4 teams.",
