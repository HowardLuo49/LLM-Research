However, each student dislikes three of their classmates. Dislike between students need not be mutual. If the teams do not need to be equally sized, how many must be created so that no student is the teammate of someone they dislike?\nA: 4\nB: 7\nC: 10\nD: 13",

    "gpt_response": "Let's say there are 20 students in the class. Each student dislikes 3 other students, so we need to make sure they are not on the same team.\n\nIf we divide the class into 4 teams, each student will be on a team with 4 other students, and only one of those 3 disliked students can be on the same team.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 5 teams to make sure no student is on the same team as someone they dislike.\n\nSo, the answer is A: 4 teams.",
