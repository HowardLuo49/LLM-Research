What is the work done by F on a particle that moves along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3) between time t=0 and time t=1?\nA: -1/4\nB: -1/(4sqrt(2))\nC: 0\nD: sqrt(2)",

    "gpt_response": "So, we are talking about a force called F that always goes in the direction (-1, 0, 1). A particle is moving along a path that looks like (t, t^2, t^3) for time t=0 to t=1. We want to know how much work is being done by the force F on the particle. \n\nWell, work is calculated using the formula W = F * d, where F is the force and d is the displacement. The force in this case is constant and parallel to (-1, 0, 1), so the force vector is (-1, 0, 1). \n\nThe displacement is the change in position from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1) because the particle is moving along the path (t, t^2, t^3) from t=0 to t=1. The change in position is (1, 1, 1) - (0, 0, 0) = (1, 1, 1).\n\nNow we calculate the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector:\n(-1, 0, 1) \u00b7 (1, 1, 1) = -1*1 + 0*1 + 1*1 = 0\n\nSince the dot product is 0, the work done by the force F on the particle is 0. So the answer is C: 0.",
