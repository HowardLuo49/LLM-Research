    "gpt_response": "To tackle this question, we need to utilize the properties of matrices and the trace function. Let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\nI. The trace of A^2 is nonnegative:\nLet's first consider the trace of a matrix A. The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements of the matrix. If we consider A^2, then the trace of A^2 would be the sum of the squares of the diagonal elements of A. Since squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the trace of A^2 is nonnegative. Therefore, Statement I is TRUE.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative:\nIf A^2 = A, then we can rewrite this as A^2 - A = 0, which can be factored as A(A - I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. This implies that either A = 0 or A = I. In both cases, the trace of A is nonnegative. Therefore, Statement II is TRUE.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B:\nConsider matrices A and B with dimensions n x n. The trace of a product of matrices is not necessarily the product of the traces of the individual matrices. This statement is false in general. For example, let A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]], then the trace of AB is 1*5 + 2*7 + 3*6 + 4*8 = 70, which is not equal to the product of the traces of A and B (5*6 = 30). Therefore, Statement III is FALSE.\n\nCombining the analysis above, we see that Statements I and II are TRUE while Statement III is FALSE. Therefore, the correct answer is C: I and II only.",
