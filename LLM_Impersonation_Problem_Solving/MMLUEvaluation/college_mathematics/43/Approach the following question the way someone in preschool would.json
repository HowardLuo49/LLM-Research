But I know that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. Maybe if we add up the diagonal entries of A^2, we'll get a nonnegative number.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\nThis one sounds a bit tricky. If A^2 is equal to A, maybe that means the diagonal entries are the same? I think this might be true because if the diagonal entries are the same, adding them up would give a nonnegative number.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\nHmm... I'm not too sure about this one either. But maybe if we multiply the traces of A and B, we'll get the trace of AB. I'm not totally convinced, but it's worth considering.\n\nSo, after thinking about it, I think the statement that is definitely true is II. So, I would choose answer choice C: I and II only.
