The first one that comes to mind is a line of 5 vertices, which is a tree. Another option could be a 4-vertex line with an additional vertex branching off from one of the middle vertices. I think that would also be a tree. Then, we could have a 3-vertex line with two additional vertices branching off from the ends... I think that would also be a tree. Lastly, we could have a 3-vertex line with one additional vertex branching off from one of the end vertices, and a separate 2-vertex line branching off from the middle vertex. Okay, so I think there are 4 different nonisomorphic trees possible with 5 vertices. So... my answer would be D: 4.",
