If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "Okay, so let's break this down. First, we need to understand what the words mean. \n\n1. Compact means that K is closed and bounded. \n2. Bounded means that the values of the function cannot go to infinity, they stay within a certain range.\n3. Connected means that there are no breaks in K, it is all one piece.\n\nNow let's look at the statements:\n\nI. If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\n- This statement is true because if K is compact, it is bounded, so any function defined on it will also be bounded. \n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. Just because the functions are bounded does not mean that K is compact. \n\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\n- This statement is true because if K is compact, it is closed and bounded, and a closed and bounded set is always connected.\n\nSo the correct answer is D: I and III only.",
