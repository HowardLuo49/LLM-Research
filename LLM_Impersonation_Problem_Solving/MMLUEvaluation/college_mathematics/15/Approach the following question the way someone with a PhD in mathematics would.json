If K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded.\nThis statement is a known fact in mathematical analysis. If K is compact, then any continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded due to the nature of compact sets. This is a direct consequence of the Extreme Value Theorem.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nThis statement is not true. Just because all continuous real-valued functions defined on K are bounded does not imply that K is compact. For example, a closed interval in R that is not bounded is not compact, but all continuous real-valued functions defined on it would be bounded.\n\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nThis statement is also true. A compact set in R^n is closed and bounded, and any closed and bounded set in R^n is also connected. This is a basic property of compact sets in Euclidean spaces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: D) I and III only.",
