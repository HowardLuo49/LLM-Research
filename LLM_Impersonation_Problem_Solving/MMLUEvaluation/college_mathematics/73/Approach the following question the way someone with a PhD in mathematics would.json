Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the eigenvalues of matrix A by setting the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) to zero and solving for \u03bb:\n\n-\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3 = 0\n\nFactorizing this polynomial, we get:\n\n-(\u03bb - 3)(\u03bb + 1)(\u03bb + 1) = 0\n\nThis gives us eigenvalues of \u03bb = 3, -1, -1. \n\nI. The trace of A is 3: The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. So, if the eigenvalues are 3, -1, -1, the trace of A would be 3. Therefore, statement I is TRUE.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3: The determinant of A is the product of its eigenvalues. In this case, -3 * -1 * -1 = -3. Therefore, statement II is TRUE.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1: This statement is false, as we found the eigenvalues to be 3, -1, -1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: I and II only.",
