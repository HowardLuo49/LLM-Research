Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",

    "gpt_response": "To find the trace of the matrix A, you need to add up the diagonal elements of the matrix. Since the trace is not given in the question, you cannot determine if it equals 3. Therefore, statement I cannot be true.\n\nTo find the determinant of A, you can substitute \u03bb = 0 into the given equation. This will give you the determinant of A. If the determinant is -3, then statement II would be true. If not, statement II would be false.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues of A, you need to set det(A - \u03bbI) = 0 and solve for \u03bb. If the eigenvalues you find are -3 and 1, then statement III would be true. If not, statement III would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine which of the statements are true with the given information. The correct answer is D: I and II only.",
