Suppose A is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix such that det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = \u2212\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb \u2212 3, where I is the 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix. Which of the following are TRUE of A?\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nII. The determinate of A is \u22123.\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues \u22123 and 1.\nA: I only\nB: II only\nC: III only\nD: I and II only",
    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. To find the trace of matrix A, we need to add up the values on the main diagonal. So, the trace of A would be -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb, which is not equal to 3. So, statement I is not true.\n\nNext, we can find the determinant of matrix A by setting the characteristic equation to 0. So, det(A) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3. This means the determinant of A is indeed -3. So, statement II is true.\n\nLastly, to find the eigenvalues of A, we need to set the characteristic equation equal to 0 and solve for \u03bb. Doing this, we get eigenvalues of -3 and 1. So, statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: C: III only.",
