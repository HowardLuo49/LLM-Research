    "solution": "B",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum possible area of the yard, we need to remember that the area of a rectangle is length times width. Since we have a fixed amount of fencing to make three sides of the rectangle, the length and width have to add up to x. \n\nLet's call the length of the rectangle L and the width W. Since we have three sides of fencing, the perimeter of the rectangle would be L + W + L = 2L + W = x. This means that W = x - 2L. \n\nNow, we can write the area of the rectangle in terms of L: A = L * (x - 2L). To find the maximum possible area, we can use calculus, but let's just simplify the formula first.\n\nA = Lx - 2L^2. \n\nTo find the maximum, we need to differentiate the formula with respect to L, and set it equal to zero. \n\ndA/dL = x - 4L = 0. \n\nNow, we solve for L: \n\n4L = x. \n\nL = x/4. \n\nNow that we have the value of L, we can find the value of W: \n\nW = x - 2(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2. \n\nNow, we plug these values back into the area formula: \n\nA = (x/4)(x/2) = x^2/8. \n\nSo, the maximum possible area of the yard in terms of x is x^2/8. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: x^2/8.",
