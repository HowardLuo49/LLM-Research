    "gpt_response": "Okay, let's break this down. \n\nI. If f is one-to-one and onto, that means every element in the codomain has exactly one corresponding element in the domain. This could be true because the function is from (0, 1) to (0, 1], so there is one less possibility for each element in the codomain to map to. So, I could be TRUE.\n\nII. If the image of f is compact, that means it is closed and bounded. Since the function is from (0, 1) to (0, 1], the image could be closed. However, the image is not necessarily bounded because the function is mapping to (0, 1] which does not have a maximum value. So, II could be FALSE.\n\nIII. If f is continuous, one-to-one, and onto, then it means that the function is well-behaved, injective, and surjective. Since it is continuous, it implies that the image of f is connected and compact. So, III could be TRUE.\n\nSo considering all this, I think the answer is D: I and III only.",
