    "gpt_response": "Okie dokie! So if we have a group G with a subgroup of order seven, that means there are seven elements in that subgroup. Also, if no element (except the identity) is its own inverse, that means that every element in the group has a partner that is different from itself. \n\nSo let's think about it! Since the subgroup has 7 elements, and each element has a partner that is different from itself, that means each pair of elements in the subgroup makes up one element in the bigger group. So in total, the subgroup and its partners have 14 elements. \n\nThat leaves us with the rest of the elements in the group, which are all paired up with other elements. So if we add those pairs up, that means there are 14 pairs, which gives us 28 elements in total.\n\nSo the order of G could be 28, which is answer choice B! Yay, we did it!",
