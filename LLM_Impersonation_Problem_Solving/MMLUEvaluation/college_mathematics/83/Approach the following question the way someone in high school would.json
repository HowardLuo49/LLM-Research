    "solution": "C",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, so we know that G contains a subgroup of order seven, which means that the order of G must be divisible by seven. Also, we know that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse, so each element must have an inverse that is not itself. This means that the order of G must be odd.\n\nLooking at the options, the only odd number that is divisible by seven is 35, so the answer is C: 35.",
