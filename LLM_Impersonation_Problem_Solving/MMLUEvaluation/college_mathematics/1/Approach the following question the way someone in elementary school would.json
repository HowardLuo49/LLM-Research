    "gpt_response": "If we have a group G of order 16 where x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G, we want to see how many of these groups can exist. This means that every element in the group must have order 1, 2, 4, or 8.\n\nLet's start with the identity element, which must be 0. This means that there must be an element of order 2, an element of order 4, and an element of order 8 in the group. \n\nIf we have an element of order 2, we must also have an element of order 4 that is not a multiple of the one of order 2. If we have an element of order 4, we must also have an element of order 8 that is not a multiple of the one of order 4. So, there is only one way to form a group like this.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 1.",
