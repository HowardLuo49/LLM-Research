    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "Hmm, let's see. So we're looking for additive abelian groups of order 16 where x + x + x + x = 0 for any x in the group. Since the order of the group is 16, it can be written as 2^4. \n\nWe know that in an additive group, the order of an element divides the order of the group. So for any element x in the group, the order of x must divide 16. This means the possible orders of elements in the group are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.\n\nIf we have an element of order 16, say y, then y + y + y + y = 0 implies that 4y = 0. Since the order of y is 16, this means 4 is not a zero divisor in the group. \n\nThis leads us to conclude that there is only one such group of order 16 up to isomorphism that satisfies the property x + x + x + x = 0. So the answer is B: 1.",
