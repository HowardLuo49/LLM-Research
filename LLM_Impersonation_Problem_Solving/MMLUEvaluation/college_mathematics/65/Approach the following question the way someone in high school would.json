    "gpt_response": "To determine which of the following expressions must be divisible by 11 when 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, we should use the given information to solve the problem\n\nThe expression 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. This implies that:\n3x + 7y \u2261 0 (mod 11)\n\nNow let's check the answer choices one by one:\n\nA: 4x + 6y\nIf we substitute this into the equation above, we get:\n4x + 6y \u2261 x - y \u2261 0 (mod 11)\nThis is not necessarily divisible by 11, so we can eliminate this option.\n\nB: x + y + 5\nIf we substitute this into the equation above, we get:\nx + y + 5 \u2261 x + y + 5 \u2261 5 (mod 11)\nThis is not necessarily divisible by 11, so we can eliminate this option.\n\nC: 9x + 4y\nIf we substitute this into the equation above, we get:\n9x + 4y \u2261 -2x + 4y \u2261 0 (mod 11)\nThis is not necessarily divisible by 11, so we can eliminate this option.\n\nD: 4x - 9y\nIf we substitute this into the equation above, we get:\n4x - 9y \u2261 x - 9y \u2261 0 (mod 11)\nThis must be divisible by 11 because x - 9y is one of the multiples that add up to 0 in the equation 3x + 7y \u2261 0 (mod 11).\n\nTherefore, the answer is option D: 4x - 9y.",
