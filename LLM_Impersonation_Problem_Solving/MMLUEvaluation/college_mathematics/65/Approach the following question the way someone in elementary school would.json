    "solution": "D",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we first need to find out which number we can divide by 11. It's a little hard to tell, but we can try putting in some numbers to start.\n\nLet's say x is 1 and y is 1. We can see that 3(1) + 7(1) = 3 + 7 = 10. Since 10 is not divisible by 11, this doesn't help us much.\n\nLet's try x being 2 and y being 1. Then 3(2) + 7(1) = 6 + 7 = 13. Since 13 is also not divisible by 11, this also doesn't help us.\n\nWe can keep trying out different numbers, but we might not be able to find it by just guessing. So, one trick we can use is to create an equation.\n\nIf we have 3x + 7y and this is divisible by 11, then we can say that 11 divides 3x + 7y. This means that 11 divides (3x + 7y) - (3x - 4y) = 11 divides 11y. This means that 11 must also divide 11y.\n\nSo, the answer is C, 9x + 4y, because if 11 divides 11y, then it must also divide 9x + 4y.",
