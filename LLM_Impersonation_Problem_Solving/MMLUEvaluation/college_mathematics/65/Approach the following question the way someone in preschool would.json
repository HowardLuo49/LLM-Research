    "gpt_response": "Let's see, we know that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, that means it can be divided by 11 and have no remainders. Now let's check which of these number expressions can also be divided by 11 with no remainders.\n\nLet's start with the first one, 4x + 6y. Hmm, this doesn't seem to be the same as the first one that we know is divisible by 11. Let's try the next one, x + y + 5. Oh, this one doesn't look like it can be divided by 11 either. \n\nHow about 9x + 4y, does that seem familiar? Not really, but wait, what about 4x - 9y? That looks like it could be a possibility. Maybe that one is divisible by 11.\n\nSo now we have to make a guess, out of the options given, which one do we think might be divisible by 11. I think D, 4x - 9y, seems like the best choice because it looks the most similar to the first one we know is divisible by 11. Yay, we did it!",
