    "gpt_response": "Alright, so we know that A and B are similar matrices. That means there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P^-1AP. Now, let's analyze the statements one by one.\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices:\nIf we subtract 2I from both A and B, we get A - 2I = P^-1AP - 2I = P^-1AP - P^-1(2I)P = P^-1(A - 2I)P. So, A - 2I and B - 2I are indeed similar matrices. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace:\nSince A and B are similar matrices, they have the same eigenvalues, and thus the same trace. So, statement II is true.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices:\nSince A and B are similar, we know that B = P^-1AP. Taking the inverse of both sides, we get B^-1 = (P^-1)^-1A^-1P^-1 = PA^-1P^-1. Therefore, A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices. So, statement III is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",
