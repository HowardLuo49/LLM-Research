    "gpt_response": "If A and B are similar matrices, that means there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = PAP^(-1). \n\nI. To see if A - 2I and B - 2I are similar, we can substitute B = PAP^(-1) into the expression to get B - 2I = PAP^(-1) - 2P(IP^(-1)). Simplifying further, we get B - 2I = P(A - 2I)P^(-1). So, A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices, making statement I true.\n\nII. Two matrices having the same trace is not necessarily a property of similar matrices, so statement II is not always true.\n\nIII. We know that A and B are similar matrices, which means B = PAP^(-1). Taking the inverse of both sides, we get B^(-1) = (P^(-1))A^(-1)P. So, A^(-1) and B^(-1) are indeed similar matrices, making statement III true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: I only.",
