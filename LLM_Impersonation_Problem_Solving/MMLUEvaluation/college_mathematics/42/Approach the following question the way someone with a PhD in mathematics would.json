If f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4) such that f(3) = 5 and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, what is the greatest possible value of f(0)?\nA: 3\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 8",

    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible value of f(0), we need to maximize the value of f(x) under the given conditions. Since f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, this means that f(x) is a non-decreasing function.\n\nSince f(3) = 5, and f(0) is asking for the greatest possible value of f(0), we can use the fact that f(x) is non-decreasing to conclude that the greatest possible value of f(0) would occur when f(x) is increasing at its maximum rate. This occurs when f'(x) = -1, as this would mean that f(x) is increasing at the fastest possible rate.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) would occur when f'(x) = -1 for all x, and thus f(x) = 5 - (3-x) = 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: 8",
