If f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4) such that f(3) = 5 and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, what is the greatest possible value of f(0)?\nA: 3\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 8",

    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible value of f(0), we should look at the information given. We know that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, and that f(3) = 5. This means that f is increasing and the rate of increase is not faster than -1. Since we are looking for the greatest possible value of f(0), we want to maximize f(0).\n\nSince f is continuously differentiable, we can use the Mean Value Theorem to find that for some c in (-1, 0), f'(c) = (f(0) - f(-1))/(0 - (-1)). Since f'(c) is greater than or equal to -1, we have (f(0) - f(-1))/(0 - (-1)) \u2265 -1. This simplifies to (f(0) - f(-1)) \u2265 -1. \n\nSince we want to maximize f(0), we want to make (f(0) - f(-1)) as large as possible. The largest value f(-1) can be is 5 (since f(3) = 5 and f is increasing), so the largest value f(0) can be is 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of f(0) is 6.",
