If f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on the open interval (-1, 4) such that f(3) = 5 and f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x, what is the greatest possible value of f(0)?\nA: 3\nB: 4\nC: 5\nD: 8",

    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible value of f(0), we need to maximize f(0) based on the given information. Since f'(x) is always greater than or equal to -1, this means that f(x) is always increasing or staying the same.\n\nTherefore, to maximize f(0), we need to find the largest possible value of f(x) closest to 0. From the given information, we know that f(3) = 5. Since f(x) is always increasing or staying the same, the largest possible value of f(x) closest to 0 would be f(3) = 5.\n\nSo the greatest possible value of f(0) is 5, which corresponds to answer choice C: 5.",
