    "gpt_response": "To find out if v is an eigenvector of 2A, we can see that if we write out the eigenvalue equation for 2A, we get (2A)v = 2(Av). Since Av is the same as \u03bbv (where \u03bb is the eigenvalue of A), we can see that 2(Av) is the same as 2(\u03bbv) which equals 2\u03bbv. This shows that v is indeed an eigenvector of 2A with eigenvalue 2\u03bb, so I is true.\n\nTo find out if v is an eigenvector of A^2, we can write out the eigenvalue equation for A^2, which is (A^2)v = A(Av). Since Av is the same as \u03bbv (where \u03bb is the eigenvalue of A), we can see that A(Av) is the same as A(\u03bbv) which equals \u03bb(Av). Since Av is \u03bbv, this is the same as \u03bb(\u03bbv) which equals \u03bb^2v. This shows that v is indeed an eigenvector of A^2 with eigenvalue \u03bb^2, so II is true.\n\nTo find out if v is an eigenvector of A^(-1), we can write out the eigenvalue equation for A^(-1), which is (A^(-1))v = \u03bbv. Since v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, we can see that (A^(-1))v = \u03bbv. This shows that v is indeed an eigenvector of A^(-1) with eigenvalue \u03bb, so III is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: I, II, and III.",
