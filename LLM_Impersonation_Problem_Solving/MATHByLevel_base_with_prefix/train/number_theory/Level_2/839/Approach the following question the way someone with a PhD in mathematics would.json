    "solution": "There are five prime numbers between $4$ and $18:$ namely $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ and $17.$ Hence the product of any two of these is odd and the sum is even. Because $$xy-(x+y)=(x-1)(y-1)-1$$increases as either $x$ or $y$ increases (since both $x$ and $y$ are bigger than $1$), the answer must be an odd number that is no smaller than $$23=5\\cdot 7-(5+7)$$and no larger than $$191=13\\cdot 17-(13+17).$$The only possibility among the options is $\\boxed{119},$ and indeed $119=11\\cdot 13-(11+13).$",

Therefore, we are looking for values of $pq - (p+q)$.\n\nBy expanding the expression, we get:\n$pq - (p+q) = pq - p - q = pq - p - q + 1 - 1 = (p-1)(q-1) - 1$\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, neither of them can be even, so $p-1$ and $q-1$ are even. This means that their product $(p-1)(q-1)$ is divisible by $4$.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $(p-1)(q-1)$:\n- For $p=5$ or $q=5$, $(p-1)(q-1) = 4$\n- For $p=7$ or $q=7$, $(p-1)(q-1) = 6$\n- For $p=11$ or $q=11$, $(p-1)(q-1) = 10$\n- For $p=13$ or $q=13$, $(p-1)(q-1) = 12$\n- For $p=17$ or $q=17$, $(p-1)(q-1) = 16$\n\nSubtracting $1$ from each of these values, we get:\n$3, 5, 9, 11, 15$\n\nTherefore, the only possible value that could be obtained by subtracting the sum of two prime numbers between $4$ and $18$ from their product is $\\boxed{119}$.",
