    "solution": "An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.  The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the multiple of 15 closest to 2009, we can divide 2009 by 15 to find the quotient and remainder. \n\n2009 divided by 15 is approximately 133.9333, with a remainder of 14. \n\nTherefore, the closest multiple of 15 to 2009 is 15 * 134 = 2010. \n\nThus, the multiple of 15 closest to 2009 is 2010.",
