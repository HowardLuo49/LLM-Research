    "solution": "The smallest four-digit palindromes have $1$ on each end.  $1001$ is not divisible by $3$, nor is $1111$, but $\\boxed{1221}$ is, so it is the smallest possible.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 3, we can first list out all the four-digit palindromes:\n\n1001, 1111, 1221, ..., 9889, 9999\n\nSince the number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.
