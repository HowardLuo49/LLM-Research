    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of rows with 8 people.  If we removed a person from each of these rows, then every row would contain 7 people.  Therefore, $46 - x$ must be divisible by 7.\n\nThen $x \\equiv 46 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.  The first few positive integers that satisfy this congruence are 4, 11, 18, and so on.  However, each row contains at least 7 people.  If there were 7 or more rows, then there would be at least $7 \\cdot 7 = 49$ people.  We only have 46 people, so there must be at most six rows.  Therefore, the number of rows with 8 people is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of rows seating 7 people and y be the number of rows seating 8 people.\n\nSince each row seats either 7 or 8 people, we have the equation:\nx + y = total number of rows.\n\nSince the total number of people is 46, we have another equation:\n7x + 8y = 46.\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously. \n\nFrom the first equation, we have:\nx = total number of rows - y.\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n7(total number of rows - y) + 8y = 46\n7total number of rows - 7y + 8y = 46\n7total number of rows + y = 46.\n\nNow we can solve for y:\ny = 46 - 7x.\n\nSince y represents the number of rows seating 8 people, to find the number of such rows we substitute this last equation back into the original equation (x + y = total number of rows):\nx + 46 - 7x = total number of rows\n46 - 6x = total number of rows.\n\nNow we need to find the values of x that satisfy both equations. \nSince each row seats either 7 or 8 people, x must be a non-negative integer. We notice that to satisfy the constraints, x must lie between 0 and 7 (considering that if x = 8, then we can't have any rows seating 8 people).\n\nSubstituting x = 0 gives y = 46 and implies 0 rows seating 7 people and 46 rows seating 8 people. While plugging x = 1, we get y = 39 and so on. \n\nTherefore, we have 4 rows seating 8 people because 46 - 7(4) = 22.",
