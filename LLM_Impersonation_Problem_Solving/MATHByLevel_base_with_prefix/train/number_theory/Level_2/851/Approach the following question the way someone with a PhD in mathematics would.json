    "solution": "We use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with the units digit of $2$ has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ and we have $10$ numbers,  $$2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92 \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1024 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{5}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the product $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$ is divided by $5$, we can first observe that each term in the product is congruent to $2$ modulo $5$. This is because every term except for the first one ends in $2$, and when multiplied by an even number like $2$, the result is again congruent to $2$ modulo $5$.\n\nThus, we can simplify the problem to finding the remainder when $2^{10}$ is divided by $5$. Since $2^{10} = 1024$, the remainder is $4$ when divided by $5$. Therefore, the remainder when $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$ is divided by $5$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
