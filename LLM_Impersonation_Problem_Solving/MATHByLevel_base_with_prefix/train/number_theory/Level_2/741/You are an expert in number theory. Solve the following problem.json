    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18, we need to find the largest possible number that can be formed by the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 with a sum of 18.\n\nThe possible combinations that add up to 18 are:\n\n9 + 6 + 3 = 18\n9 + 5 + 4 = 18\n8 + 7 + 3 = 18\n8 + 6 + 4 = 18\n\nOut of these combinations, the largest number is 963. Since this number is already a multiple of 9, the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18 is 963.",
