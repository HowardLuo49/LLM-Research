    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two consecutive positive integers be n and n+1. We have the equation n(n+1) = 210.\n\nExpanding the left side, we get n^2 + n = 210. Rearranging, we have the quadratic equation n^2 + n - 210 = 0. \n\nSolving for n using the quadratic formula, we get n = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 840)) / 2 = 14. \n\nTherefore, the two consecutive positive integers are 14 and 15.\n\nTo find the three consecutive integers that multiply to 210, we can use the fact that 210 = 2*3*5*7. Thus, the three integers are 5, 6, and 7.\n\nThe sum of the five integers is 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 47.",
