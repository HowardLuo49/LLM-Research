    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first find the two consecutive positive integers that multiply to 210. We know that 210 can be factored as 2*3*5*7, so the two consecutive integers are 14 and 15 (14*15 = 210).\n\nNext, we find the three consecutive integers that multiply to 210. Since 210 has prime factors 2, 3, 5, and 7, we can see that 210 is 2*3*5*7. This indicates that the three consecutive integers are 5, 6, and 7 (5*6*7 = 210).\n\nFinally, we calculate the sum of the five integers: 14 + 15 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 47.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the five integers is 47.",
