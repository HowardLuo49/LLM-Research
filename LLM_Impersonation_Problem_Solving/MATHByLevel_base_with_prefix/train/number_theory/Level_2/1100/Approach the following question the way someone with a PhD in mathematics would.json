    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For a certain natural number $n$, $n^2$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, and $n^3$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. What remainder does $n$ give when divided by 5?",
    "solution": "If two numbers give the same remainder when divided by 5, they are said to be equivalent, modulo 5.  From $n^2$ to $n^3$, we have multiplied by $n$.  Since $n^2$ is equivalent to 4 (modulo 5), and $n^3$ is equivalent to 2 (modulo 5), we are looking for an integer $n$ for which $4\\cdot n$ is equivalent to 2, modulo 5.  Notice that if $n$ is greater than 4, then we can replace it with its remainder when divided by 5 without changing whether it satisfies the condition. Therefore, we may assume that $0\\leq n <5$.  Trying 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, we find that only $\\boxed{3}$ times 4 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can use the principle of modular arithmetic. \n\nGiven that $n^2$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, we can express this as $n^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nSimilarly, since $n^3$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, we have $n^3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. \n\nIn modular arithmetic, we know that $(a \\cdot b) \\equiv (a \\pmod{m}) \\cdot (b \\pmod{m}) \\pmod{m}$.
