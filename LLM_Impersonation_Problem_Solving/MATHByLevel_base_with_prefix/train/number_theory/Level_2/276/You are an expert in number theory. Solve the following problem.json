    "solution": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47, we need to find the smallest multiple of 47 that is greater than 1000.\n\nWe can start by dividing 1000 by 47:\n\n1000 \u00f7 47 \u2248 21.28\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of 47 greater than 1000 is:\n47 * 22 = 1034\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47 is 1034.",
