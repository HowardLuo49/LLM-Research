    "solution": "We divide 1000 by 47 and get a remainder of 13. Therefore, if we subtract 13 from 1000, we should get an integer divisible by 47. Since $1000-13 = 987$ and 987 is divisible by 47, we can then add 47 to 987 to get the smallest four-digit integer that is divisible by 47, namely $987+47 = \\boxed{1034}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47, we must determine the smallest multiple of 47 that falls within the range of four-digit integers.\n\nSince 47 is a prime number, the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47 will be the first multiple of 47 greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nTo find this multiple, we divide 1000 by 47 to see how many times 47 fits into 1000. \n\n1000 \u00f7 47 = 21.2765\n\nThis means that the smallest multiple of 47 greater than or equal to 1000 is 47 * 22 = 1034.\n\nTherefore, the smallest four-digit positive integer that is divisible by 47 is 1034.",
