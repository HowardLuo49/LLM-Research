    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For the opening home game of the baseball season, the Madd Batters minor league baseball team offered the following incentives to its fans:\n\nEvery 75th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free hot dog.\n\nEvery 30th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free cup of soda.\n\nEvery 50th fan who entered the stadium got a coupon for a free bag of popcorn.\n\nThe stadium holds 4000 fans and was completely full for this game. How many of the fans at the game were lucky enough to receive all three free items?",
    "solution": "We are asked to count the common multiples of $\\{75,30,50\\}$ among the positive integers less than or equal to $4000$.  Since $75=3\\cdot 5^2$, $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot 5$, and $50=2\\cdot 5^2$, the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2=150$.  Since every common multiple is divisible by the least common multiple, we may count the multiples of $150$ less than $4000$. We divide $4000$ by $150$ and find a quotient of $\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50 since a fan would need to be a multiple of each of these numbers in order to receive all three free items.\n\nThe least common multiple of 75, 30, and 50 is the smallest number that is divisible by each of these numbers without any remainder. To find the least common multiple, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number:\n\n75 = 3 * 5^2\n30 = 2 * 3 * 5\n50 = 2 * 5^2\n\nNow we take the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations:\n\nLCM(75, 30, 50) = 2 * 3 * 5^2 = 150\n\nTherefore, every 150th fan who entered the stadium would receive all three free items.\n\nSince the stadium holds 4000 fans, we simply divide 4000 by 150 to find out how many fans were lucky enough to receive all three free items:\n\n4000 / 150 = 26.67\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a fan, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\n26 fans were lucky enough to receive all three free items at the game.",
