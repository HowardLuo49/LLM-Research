    "solution": "We have $840=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. From this prime factorization, it is clear that the product of four consecutive positive integers is $840=2^2\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\cdot3)\\cdot7=4\\cdot5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The largest of the four integers is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four consecutive integers be x, x+1, x+2, and x+3. Since their product is 840, we have:\n\nx(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = 840.\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\nx(x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6) = 840.\n\nx^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x = 840.\n\nRearranging terms and simplifying, we get:\n\nx^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x - 840 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of 840 that can be expressed in the form x^4 + 6x^3 + 11x^2 + 6x. \n\nFactoring 840, we get:\n\n840 = 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 7.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that the factors that work are 5, 6, 7, and 8:\n\n5 * 6 * 7 * 8 = 840.\n\nSo, the largest of the four integers is x+3 = 8. \n\nTherefore, the largest of the four integers is 8.",
