    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. You have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends. However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. You have less than 100 gold coins. What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let n represent the number of gold coins you have. You have divided your gold coins into 11 equal piles, meaning each pile has n/11 gold coins. Additionally, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin if you give away all your gold coins. This implies that the total number of gold coins, n, must be divisible by 11 and have a remainder of 2 when divided by 11.\n\nThis can be mathematically represented as:\nn = 11k + 2, where k is an integer.\n\nSince you have less than 100 gold coins, we need to find the largest possible value of n that satisfies the above condition:\n\nn = 11k + 2 < 100\n11k < 98\nk < 8.909\n\nTherefore, the largest integer value of k that satisfies the inequality is k = 8. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is when k = 8:\nn = 11(8) + 2\nn = 90\n\nSo, the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this situation is 90 gold coins.",
