    "solution": "The prime factorization of 30 is $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. A factor of 30 can have zero or one power of 2, zero or one power of 3, and zero or one power of 5. Thus, there are $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ factors of 30. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of 30, we first factorize it as 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.\n\nNow, to find the total number of factors of 30, we add 1 to the power of each prime factor and multiply them together:\n\n(1 + 1) * (1 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8\n\nTherefore, 30 has 8 positive factors.",
