    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?",
    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110, we can start by listing the odd numbers within this range:\n\n11, 13, 15, ..., 107, 109\n\nSince we are only interested in the units digit, we can focus on the units digits of these numbers:\n\n1, 3, 5, ..., 7, 9\n\nTo find the units digit of the product, we can multiply the units digits of these numbers sequentially:\n\n1 * 3 * 5 * ... * 7 * 9\n\nThe units digit of the product will only depend on the units digits of the factors involved. We can use the property of modular arithmetic that the units digit of a product is the product of the units digits of the factors.\n\nIn this case, the units digit of the product will be 5, as it is the product of all the odd units digits from 1 to 9. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5.",
