    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. What is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?",
    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110, we can first list out all the odd numbers in that range:\n\n11, 13, 15, ..., 109\n\nWe notice that the units digits of the odd numbers repeat in a pattern: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...\n\nSo, if we multiply all these numbers together, the units digit will be the product of the units digits of the numbers:\n\n1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 = 945\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all odd positive integers between 10 and 110 is 5.",
