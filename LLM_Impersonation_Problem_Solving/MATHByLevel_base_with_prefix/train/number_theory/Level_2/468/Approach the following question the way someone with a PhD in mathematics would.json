    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7), we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these four numbers.\n\nThe prime factorization of each of these prime numbers is as follows:\n- 2 = 2\n- 3 = 3\n- 5 = 5\n- 7 = 7\n\nThe LCM of these four numbers is the product of the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations of the numbers. So, the LCM is:\nLCM(2, 3, 5, 7) = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by 210. The smallest four-digit number is 1000, so we need to find the smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nDividing 1000 by 210 gives:\n1000 \u00f7 210 = 4 remainder 40\n\nSo, the smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than or equal to 1000 is:\n210 * 5 = 1050\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7) is 1050.",
