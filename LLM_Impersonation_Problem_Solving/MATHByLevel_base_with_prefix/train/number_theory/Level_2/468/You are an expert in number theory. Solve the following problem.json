    "solution": "We want to find the smallest four-digit number that is a multiple of lcm[2, 3, 5, 7] = 210, so we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $$ 210n \\ge 1000. $$Dividing this inequality by 210 we get $n \\ge 4\\, \\frac{16}{21}$, so $n = 5$ gives us the smallest four-digit multiple of 210: $210 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The four smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nTo find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of these prime numbers, we can calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these four numbers.\n\nLCM(2, 3, 5, 7) = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210\n\nSince we are looking for a four-digit number, we need to find the smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than or equal to 1000.\n\nThe smallest multiple of 210 that is greater than 1000 is 1050.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by each of the four smallest prime numbers is 1050.",
