    "solution": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the 42nd card in Emily's order, we first need to find the remainder when dividing 42 by 13 (the number of cards in one suit). \n\n42 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 3. This means that the 42nd card is 3 cards past the last card in the third iteration of the suit order.\n\nSince the order starts with Ace (1st card) and ends with King (13th card), the 39th card is King, the 40th card is Ace, the 41st card is 2, and the 42nd card is 3.\n\nTherefore, the 42nd card is 3.",
