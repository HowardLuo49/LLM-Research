    "solution": "There are $13$ cards in the pattern from $A$ to $K$. When you divide $42$ by $13$, you get $3$ with a remainder of $3$. Therefore, the $42^\\text{nd}$ card is a $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand the pattern in which the cards are ordered. The order is as follows: $A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A,2,3,\\cdots$. This sequence repeats every 13 cards.\n\nTo find the $42$nd card, we need to consider how many complete cycles of the sequence of 13 cards can fit into 42 cards. Since $42 = 3 \\times 13 + 3$, we know that we have completed 3 cycles of the sequence and are now on the 3rd card of the 4th cycle.\n\nFrom the pattern given, we can see that the 3rd card in each cycle corresponds to $4$, so the $42$nd card in the sequence will also be $4$. \n\nThus, the 42nd card in the sequence is a $4$.",
