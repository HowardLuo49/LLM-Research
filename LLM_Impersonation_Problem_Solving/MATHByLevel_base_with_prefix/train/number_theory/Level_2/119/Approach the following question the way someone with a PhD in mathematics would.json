    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of students in each of the three rows as x. Therefore, the number of students in the fourth row would be x + 1.\n\nSince there are over 30 students, we have the inequality:\n3x + (x + 1) > 30\n4x + 1 > 30\n4x > 29\nx > 7.25\n\nSince x must be a whole number (as the number of students cannot be in fractions), the smallest possible value for x would be 8. Therefore, the smallest possible class size for this physical education class would be 8 + 8 + 8 + 9 = 33 students.",
