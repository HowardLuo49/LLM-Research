    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $12$, then $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$. Their product is $d \\cdot (12/d) = 12$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$. Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3 = \\boxed{1728}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12, we first need to find all the divisors of 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nTo find the product of all the divisors, we simply multiply all these numbers together:\n1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 6 x 12 = 1728\n\nTherefore, the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12 is 1728.",
