    "solution": "The first odd multiple of 3 is 3. The next is 9, then 15, 21, adding 6 each time. The $n$th odd multiple of 3 is $6n-3$; the 10th odd multiple of 3 is therefore $60-3=\\boxed{57}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3, we first note that every odd integer is of the form 2n + 1, where n is an integer. Additionally, every multiple of 3 is of the form 3m, where m is an integer. \n\nThus, an integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 must be of the form 6k + 3, where k is an integer. \n\nTo find the tenth positive integer of this form, we can substitute k = 1, 2, 3, ... into the expression 6k + 3 and find the tenth value that satisfies both criteria. \n\nSubstituting in k = 1, we get 6(1) + 3 = 9. \nSubstituting in k = 2, we get 6(2) + 3 = 15. \nSubstituting in k = 3, we get 6(3) + 3 = 21. \nSubstituting in k = 4, we get 6(4) + 3 = 27. \n\nContinuing this process, we find that the tenth positive integer that is both odd and a multiple of 3 is 57.",
