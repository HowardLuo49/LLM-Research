    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube, we need to find numbers that can be expressed as both \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^3\\) for some integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nLet us first find the squares less than 100:\n1\u00b2 = 1\n2\u00b2 = 4\n3\u00b2 = 9\n4\u00b2 = 16\n5\u00b2 = 25\n6\u00b2 = 36\n7\u00b2 = 49\n8\u00b2 = 64\n9\u00b2 = 81\n\nNow let us find the cubes less than 100:\n1\u00b3 = 1\n2\u00b3 = 8\n3\u00b3 = 27\n4\u00b3 = 64\n\nCombining the two lists, we can see that the numbers that are both a square and a cube are 1 and 64.
