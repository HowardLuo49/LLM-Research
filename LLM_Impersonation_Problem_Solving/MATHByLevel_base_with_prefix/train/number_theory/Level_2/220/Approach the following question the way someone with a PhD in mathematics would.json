    "solution": "In order for an integer to be a square and a cube, it must also be a perfect sixth power. The only perfect sixth powers less than 100 are $1^6=1$ and $2^6=64$, so there are only $\\boxed{2}$ positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers less than 100 that are both a square and a cube, we need to find the positive integers that can be expressed as both x^2 and y^3, for some integers x and y.\n\nSince x^2 and y^3 are both positive, we can first look at the powers of 2 and 3 that are less than 100:\n\n2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32, 2^6 = 64, 2^7 = 128\n3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81\n\nWe see that the only integer that is both a square and a cube is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, there is only one positive integer less than 100 that is both a square and a cube.",
