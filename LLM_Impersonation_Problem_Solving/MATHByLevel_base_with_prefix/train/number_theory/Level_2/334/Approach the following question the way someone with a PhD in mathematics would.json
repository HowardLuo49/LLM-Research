    "solution": "First, we have $$53_6=5\\cdot6^1+3\\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\\cdot b^2+1\\cdot b^1+3\\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$. Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$. Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$. The positive value is $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that the base of a number system represents the number of unique digits that can be used to express a number. In base 6, the digits range from 0 to 5, while in base $b$, the digits range from 0 to $b-1$. \n\nGiven the information that $53_{6}$ is equal to $113_{b}$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$5*6^{1} + 3*6^{0} = 1*b^{2} + 1*b^{1} + 3*b^{0}$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$30 + 3 = b^{2} + b + 3$\n\n$33 = b^{2} + b + 3$\n\n$b^{2} + b - 30 = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve this quadratic equation for $b$. By factoring the equation, we find:\n\n$(b+6)(b-5) = 0$\n\nTherefore, the positive value of $b$ that satisfies the equation is $b=5$.",
