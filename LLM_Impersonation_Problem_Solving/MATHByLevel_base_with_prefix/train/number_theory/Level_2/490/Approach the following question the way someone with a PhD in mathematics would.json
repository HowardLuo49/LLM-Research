    "solution": "Rather than doing long division, we will write the given fraction to have a denominator of the form $10^b=2^b \\cdot 5^b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. First, we write $\\dfrac{3}{1250}$ as $\\dfrac{3}{2^1 \\cdot 5^4}$. To make the denominator fit the form $2^b \\cdot 5^b$, we make $b$ the larger of the two exponents, which in this case is $4$. Thus, we have $$\\frac{3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^1} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3}=\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^3}{5^4 \\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{24}{10^4}$$The exponent in the denominator is $4$, and $24$ are the last two digits. Therefore, there are $4-2=\\boxed{2}$ zeros between the decimal point and the first non-zero digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To express $\\frac{3}{1250}$ as a decimal, we need to divide 3 by 1250. This can be done using long division:\n\n```\n                      0.0024\n       ---------------------------\n1250 | 3.0000\n          -2500\n         ------\n           7500\n          -7500\n          ------\n              0\n```\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{3}{1250}$ is equal to 0.0024 as a decimal.
