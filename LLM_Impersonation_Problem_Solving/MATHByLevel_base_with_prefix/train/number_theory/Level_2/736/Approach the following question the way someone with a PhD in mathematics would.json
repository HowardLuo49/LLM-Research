    "solution": "A cube is divisible by $9$ if the number being cubed is divisible by $\\sqrt[3]{9}=3^{\\frac{2}{3}}.$ Since a perfect cube is the cube of an integer, we need the number being cubed to be a multiple of $3,$ so the cube is of the form $(3n)^3=27n^3$. Since $\\frac{999}{27}=37,$ the cubes we need are $27$ times a cube less than or equal to $37,$ of which there are three. However, $27\\cdot1^3=27,$ only has two digits, leaving $\\boxed{2}$ such three-digit cubes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find three-digit perfect cubes that are divisible by 9, we first note that a perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as $n^3$, where $n$ is an integer. \n\nSince we are looking for three-digit perfect cubes, the smallest three-digit perfect cube is $10^3 = 1000$ and the largest three-digit perfect cube is $21^3 = 9261$.\n\nTo determine which of these perfect cubes are divisible by 9, we need to find the perfect cubes that are multiples of 9. We can do this by looking at the prime factorization of 9, which is $3^2$. \n\nFor a perfect cube to be divisible by 9, it must contain at least two factors of 3 in its prime factorization. Taking into account the range of three-digit perfect cubes, we find that only the following perfect cubes are divisible by 9: $12^3 = 1728, 15^3 = 3375,$ and $18^3 = 5832$.\n\nTherefore, there are three three-digit perfect cubes that are divisible by 9: 1728, 3375, and 5832.",
