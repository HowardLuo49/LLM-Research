    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. It is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first convert the given time from 12-hour time format to 24-hour time format for easier calculations.\n\n12:00:00 midnight is equivalent to 00:00:00 in 24-hour time format.\n\nNow, we need to add 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds to the initial time of 00:00:00.\n\nFirst, let's break down 122 hours into days and remaining hours:\n122 hours = 5 days and 2 hours\n\nNext, we add 39 minutes and 44 seconds to the result:\n00:00:00 + 5 days + 2 hours + 39 minutes + 44 seconds\n\nConverting the days to hours:\n5 days = 5 * 24 hours = 120 hours\n\nAdding everything together:\n00:00:00 + 120 hours + 2 hours + 39 minutes + 44 seconds\n= 122 hours + 39 minutes + 44 seconds\n\nNow, let's add 122 hours to 00:00:00:\n00:00:00 + 122 hours = 02:00:00\n\nNext, we add 39 minutes and 44 seconds to 02:00:00:\n02:00:00 + 39 minutes and 44 seconds = 02:39:44\n\nTherefore, in 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds, the time will be 02:39:44 in 24-hour time format.\n\nTo find the sum of the digits of the time 02:39:44:\n2 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 4 = 22\n\nTherefore, the value of $A + B + C$ is 22.",
