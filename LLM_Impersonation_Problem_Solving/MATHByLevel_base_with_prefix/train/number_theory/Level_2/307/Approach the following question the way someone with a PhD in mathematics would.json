    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. It is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the given 122 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds into a time that corresponds to the 12-hour digital clock format. \n\nFirst, we convert the 122 hours into days and hours: 122 hours = 5 days, 2 hours. \n\nThus, the time we are looking for is at 2:39:44, 5 days later from midnight. \n\nAdding 5 days to midnight brings us to 12:00:00 noon of the 5th day. \n\nAdding 2 hours, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds to 12:00:00 noon, we get 2:39:44. \n\nTherefore, the values of A, B, and C are 2, 3, and 4 respectively. \n\nThus, $A + B + C = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9$. \n\nHence, the value of $A + B + C$ is 9.",
