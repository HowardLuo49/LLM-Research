    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible, how many people will end up with fewer than 7 cards?",
    "solution": "When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4.  Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of people that will end up with fewer than 7 cards when 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible, we first need to calculate the total number of cards each person will receive.\n\nSince 52 cards are being divided amongst 8 people, each person will receive 52/8 = 6.5 cards. However, since cards cannot be divided into fractions, each person will actually receive either 6 or 7 cards.\n\nWe need to determine how many people will receive 6 cards and how many will receive 7 cards. Since 8(6) = 48, we can see that there will be 4 remaining cards after each person receives their initial 6 cards. These 4 remaining cards will need to be distributed amongst the 8 people.\n\nSince 4 is less than the total number of people (8), there will be some people who receive an additional card, resulting in 7 cards in total. Specifically, 4 people will receive 7 cards and the remaining 4 people will receive 6 cards.\n\nTherefore, there will be 4 people who end up with fewer than 7 cards when 52 cards are dealt to 8 people as evenly as possible.",
