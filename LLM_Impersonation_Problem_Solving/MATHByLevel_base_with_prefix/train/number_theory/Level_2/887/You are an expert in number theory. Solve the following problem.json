    "solution": "When you divide 52 by 8, you get 6 with a remainder of 4.  Therefore, 4 of the people will get an extra card, bringing their total to 7, while the remaining $\\boxed{4}$ people have only 6 cards.",
    "gpt_response": "To divide 52 cards as evenly as possible among 8 people, we can give each person 6 cards, resulting in a total of 48 cards distributed. There would be 4 cards remaining.\n\nSince we have 4 cards leftover after giving each person 6 cards, only 4 people will end up with fewer than 7 cards. The other 4 people will have exactly 7 cards each.",
