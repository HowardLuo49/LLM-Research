    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A whole number is said to be ''9-heavy'' if the remainder when the number is divided by 9 is greater than 5. What is the least three-digit 9-heavy whole number?",
    "solution": "We begin by computing the residue of the smallest three digit number modulo 9.  We have \\[100\\equiv1\\pmod9.\\] Therefore 100 is not 9-heavy.  Counting up from 100 we notice that the first 9-heavy three-digit number is $\\boxed{105}$, since it has a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.",
