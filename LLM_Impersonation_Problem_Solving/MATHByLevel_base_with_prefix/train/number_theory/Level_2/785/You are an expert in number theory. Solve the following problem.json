    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Jason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to find a pattern in the sequence of hourly rates. \n\nThe hourly rates form a repeating pattern: $1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,\\dots$. We can see that this pattern repeats every 6 hours. \n\nTherefore, the first 6 hours of babysitting will cost $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$ dollars. The next 33 hours will have the same cost as the first 33 hours of this pattern, so the total cost will be 33 times the cost of the first 6 hours. \n\nSo, the total cost will be $21 \\times 33 = 693$ dollars. \n\nTherefore, Jason borrowed $\\$693$ to buy the surfboard.",
