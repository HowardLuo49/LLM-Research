    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jason borrowed money from his parents to buy a new surfboard. His parents have agreed to let him work off his debt by babysitting under the following conditions: his first hour of babysitting is worth $\\$1$, the second hour worth $\\$2$, the third hour $\\$3$, the fourth hour $\\$4$, the fifth hour $\\$5$, the sixth hour $\\$6$, the seventh hour $\\$1$, the eighth hour $\\$2$, etc. If he repays his debt by babysitting for 39 hours, how many dollars did he borrow?",
    "solution": "Every $6$ hours, Jason earns $1+2+3+4+5+6=\\$21$. Since $39=6(6)+3$, he earns $6\\cdot 21=\\$126$ from $36$ hours, and in the next $3$ hours, he earns $1+2+3=\\$6$. So he borrowed $126+6=\\boxed{\\$132}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we need to first recognize the pattern in the value of each hour of babysitting. We can see that the value of each hour follows a repeating pattern of \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2,\\ldots\\). In other words, the value of each hour is given by \\(n \\mod 6 + 1\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of hours of babysitting. \n\nSince Jason babysits for 39 hours, we can split the hours into blocks of 6 hours each, plus an additional 3 hours. In each block of 6 hours, the total value of the hours is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21 dollars. Jason babysits for 6 hours for every block, so the total value of the hours in blocks of 6 hours is 21*dollars per block. \n\nSince Jason has babysat for 39 hours, he has completed 6 full blocks and an additional 3 hours. This means the value of the 39 hours of babysitting can be calculated as 21*dollars per block * 6 blocks + the value of the additional 3 hours. These 3 additional hours have a value of 1+2+3=6 dollars. \n\nTherefore, the total value of the 39 hours of babysitting is 21*dollars per block * 6 blocks + 6 dollars for the additional 3 hours, resulting in a total of 126 + 6 = 132 dollars. \n\nIn conclusion, Jason borrowed 132 dollars from his parents to buy a new surfboard.",
