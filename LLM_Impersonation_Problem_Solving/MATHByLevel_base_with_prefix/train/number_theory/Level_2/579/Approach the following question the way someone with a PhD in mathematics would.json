    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of balloons Winnie has by adding up the number of each color of balloon: 17 red + 33 white + 65 green + 83 chartreuse = 198 total balloons.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many balloons Winnie gives to each of her friends. We know that Winnie gives out as many balloons as possible to each friend, so we can divide the total number of balloons by the number of friends: 198 total balloons / 8 friends = 24.75 balloons per friend. \n\nSince Winnie can only give whole balloons to her friends, she can give each friend 24 balloons. This means she gives out 24 balloons * 8 friends = 192 balloons in total to her friends.\n\nTo find out how many balloons Winnie keeps for herself, we subtract the number of balloons she gives to her friends from the total number of balloons she had: 198 total balloons - 192 balloons given away = 6 balloons kept for herself.\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 6 balloons for herself.",
