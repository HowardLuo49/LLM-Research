    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. It takes exactly 74 colored beads on a string to make a necklace. The beads are strung in the following order: one red, one orange, two yellow, one green, and one blue. Then the pattern repeats starting again with one red bead. If the first bead of the necklace is red, what is the color of the last bead used to make the necklace?",
    "solution": "The pattern repeats every $1+1+2+1+1=6$ beads. Since $72=6\\cdot12$, the 72nd bead will blue (the final bead to complete a pattern). The 73rd will be red, so the 74th will be $\\boxed{\\text{orange}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of beads in each cycle of the pattern. The pattern consists of 1 red bead, 1 orange bead, 2 yellow beads, 1 green bead, and 1 blue bead, which adds up to 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 beads in each cycle.\n\nSince it takes exactly 74 colored beads to make the necklace, we can determine how many complete cycles are included in the necklace by dividing 74 by 6. This results in 12 complete cycles, with 2 additional beads remaining.\n\nThe additional two beads following the complete cycles will be red (one bead) and orange (one bead), which completes the pattern of the 74 bead necklace. Therefore, the last bead used to make the necklace is orange.",
