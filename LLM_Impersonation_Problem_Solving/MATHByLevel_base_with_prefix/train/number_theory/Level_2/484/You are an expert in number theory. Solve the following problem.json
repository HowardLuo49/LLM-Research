    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "gpt_response": "The least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes would be the product of the three smallest prime numbers, which are 2, 3, and 5. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes is:\n\n2 * 3 * 5 = 30.",
