    "solution": "We use long division to find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is $0.\\overline{324}$. When $308$ is divided by $3$ there is a remainder of $2$ $\\left( 308\\div 3=102 \\ R2\\right)$. Therefore the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point is the second digit of $324$, which is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$, we first need to divide 12 by 37 and observe the pattern of digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nWhen we perform the long division of 12 by 37, we find that the decimal representation of $\\frac{12}{37}$ is approximately 0.324324324... with the pattern \"324\" repeating infinitely.\n\nSince the pattern \"324\" repeats every three digits, we can determine the digit in the 308th position by finding the remainder of 308 divided by 3, which gives a remainder of 2. Therefore, the 308th digit is the second digit in the repeating pattern, which is 2.\n\nHence, the 308th digit to the right of the decimal point when $\\frac{12}{37}$ is expressed as a decimal is 2.",
