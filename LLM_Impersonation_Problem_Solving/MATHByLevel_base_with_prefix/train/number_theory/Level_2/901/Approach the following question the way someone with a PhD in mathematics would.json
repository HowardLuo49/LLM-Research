    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct positive factors does 32 have?",
    "solution": "Since 32 is a power of 2, its only factors are the powers of 2 less than or equal to it.  These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, so there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive factors of 32.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of distinct positive factors of a given number, we must first prime factorize the number. In the case of 32, we can write it as 2^5, as 32 is equal to 2 multiplied by itself 5 times.\n\nTo find the number of distinct factors, we can apply a formula based on the prime factorization. For a number n in the form p^a * q^b * r^c * ..., where p, q, r, ... are distinct prime factors and a, b, c, ... are their respective powers, the number of distinct factors is given by the formula (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)...\n\nIn this case, since 32 = 2^5, we have a = 5. Thus, the number of distinct factors of 32 is (5+1) = 6.\n\nTherefore, 32 has 6 distinct positive factors: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.",
