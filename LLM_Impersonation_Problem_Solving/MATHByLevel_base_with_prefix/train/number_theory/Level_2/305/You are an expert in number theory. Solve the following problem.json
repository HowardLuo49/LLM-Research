    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the percentage of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$, we can count the number of integers that are divisible by $5$ and then calculate the percentage.\n\nWe can start by finding the number of multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $100$. The multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $100$ are $5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 100$. So, the total number of multiples of $5$ in this range is $20$.\n\nTherefore, there are $20$ numbers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$. The total number of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ is $100$, so the percentage of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{20}{100} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$$\n\nSo, $20\\%$ of the positive integers less than or equal to $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
