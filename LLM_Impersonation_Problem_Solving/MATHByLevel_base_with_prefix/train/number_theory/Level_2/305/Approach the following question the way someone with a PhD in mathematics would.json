    "solution": "The only numbers that leave no remainder when divided by $5$ are those that are divisible by $5$. Starting from $1,$ every five integers is divisible by $5: 5,10,15,\\ldots$ This continues even until the last group of five numbers $96$ through $100$ where $100$ is divisible by $5$. Therefore, since we have a whole number of groups of five and every group has exactly one element that is divisible by $5$, $1/5 = \\boxed{20}$ percent of the integers less than $100$ have no remainders when divided by $5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the percentage of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$, we need to determine the number of integers that are divisible by $5$ in this range.\n\nSince $5$ is a divisor of the positive integers from $1$ to $100$, we can calculate the number of integers divisible by $5$ by finding the number of multiples of $5$ in this range. \n\nThe first multiple of $5$ in this range is $5$, and the last multiple of $5$ is $100$. We can find the number of multiples of $5$ in this range by dividing the last multiple of $5$ by $5$ and subtracting the first multiple of $5$ divided by $5$. \n\nHence, the number of integers divisible by $5$ in the range $1$ to $100$ is $(\\frac{100}{5} - \\frac{5}{5}) + 1 = 20$.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of positive integers less than or equal to $100$ that have no remainders when divided by $5$ is $\\frac{20}{100} \\times 100\\% = 20\\%$.",
