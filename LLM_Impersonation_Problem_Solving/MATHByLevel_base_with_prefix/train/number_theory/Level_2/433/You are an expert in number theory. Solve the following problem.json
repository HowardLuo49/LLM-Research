    "solution": "$4444_8=4\\cdot8^3+4\\cdot8^2+4\\cdot8^1+4\\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$. Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to convert $4444_8$ to base ten.\n\n$4444_8 = 4 \\times 8^3 + 4 \\times 8^2 + 4 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0 = 2048 + 256 + 32 + 4 = 2340_{10}$\n\nSo, Kate has $2340_{10}$ dollars saved up in base ten.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cost of the round-trip airline ticket from the total amount she has saved.\n\n$2340_{10} - 1000_{10} = 1340_{10}$\n\nTherefore, Kate will have $1340_{10}$ dollars left for lodging and food after buying the airline ticket.",
