    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Winnie has 45 cherry lollipops, 116 wintergreen lollipops, 4 grape lollipops, and 229 shrimp cocktail lollipops.  With no regard to flavor, Winnie gives each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends some lollipops.  Each friend gets the same number of lollipops and she hands out as many lollipops as possible.  How many lollipops does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $45+116+4+229$ is divided by 11.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[45+116+4+229\\equiv1+6+4+9=20\\equiv9\\pmod{11}.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{9}$ lollipops left over after the distribution.  Hopefully she did not keep any shrimp cocktails.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can first calculate the total number of lollipops Winnie has: 45 (cherry) + 116 (wintergreen) + 4 (grape) + 229 (shrimp cocktail) = 394 lollipops.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends Winnie has (11) to find out how many lollipops each friend gets: 394 / 11 = 35.818181... (approximately).\n\nSince each friend must receive a whole number of lollipops, Winnie will give each friend 35 lollipops, leaving her with 394 - 35*11 = 394 - 385 = 9 lollipops remaining for herself.\n\nTherefore, Winnie ends up keeping 9 lollipops for herself after distributing lollipops to each of her 11 nearest and dearest friends.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 9?: To solve this problem, we can first calculate the total number of lollipops Winnie has: 45 (cherry) + 116 (wintergreen) + 4 (grape) + 229 (shrimp cocktail) = 394 lollipops.\n\nNext, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends Winnie has (11) to find out how many lollipops each friend gets: 394 / 11 = 35.818181...
