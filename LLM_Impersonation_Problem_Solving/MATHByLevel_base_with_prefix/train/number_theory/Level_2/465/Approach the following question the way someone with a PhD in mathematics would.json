    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits of the number. Since we are looking for the smallest number, we should try to minimize the value of A, then B, and finally C.\n\nWe know that the product of the digits is 6, so we have the equation A*B*C = 6. The possible values of A, B, and C are limited to the factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since we want to minimize the number, we should choose the smallest possible values for A, B, and C.\n\nWe start by setting A = 1. Then, the remaining digits must multiply to give 6. The smallest possible values for B and C in this case are B = 1 and C = 6. Therefore, the product of the digits of the three-digit number 116 is 6.\n\nHence, the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6, is 116.",
