    "solution": "We must minimize first the hundreds digit and then the tens digit to find the least three-digit whole number the product of whose digits is 6. The smallest possible hundreds digit is 1, and the least tens digit is 1 as well, giving a units digit of 6. Thus the least number is $\\boxed{116}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least three-digit whole number, we need to factorize the number 6 into its digits.\n\nThe prime factorization of 6 is 2*3. To form a three-digit number, we must use all the prime factors. The smallest possible three-digit number using the digits 2 and 3 is 233.\n\nTherefore, the least three-digit whole number, the product of whose digits is 6, is 233.",
