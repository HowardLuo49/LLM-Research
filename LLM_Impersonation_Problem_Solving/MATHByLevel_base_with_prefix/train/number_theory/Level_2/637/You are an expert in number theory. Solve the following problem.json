    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of Dummies in each bag.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nTo find the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, we need to find the smallest possible value of $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nSince $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$, the smallest possible value of $x$ that satisfies this condition is $x = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids is $3 \\cdot 7 \\% 9 = 21 \\% 9 = 3$.",
