    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to identify all the two-digit multiples of 7. \n\nThe first two-digit multiple of 7 is 14, and the last two-digit multiple of 7 is 98. We can calculate the number of terms in this sequence by finding the difference between the first and last term, adding 1, and then dividing by 7 (as the common difference is 7). This gives us (98-14)/7+1=14 terms.\n\nNow, we can find the arithmetic mean by summing all the terms and then dividing by the number of terms. The sum of this arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a finite arithmetic series: \n\nSum = n/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nSubstitute in the values, we have:\n\nSum = 14/2 * (14 + 98) = 7 * 112 = 784\n\nFinally, to find the arithmetic mean, we divide the sum by the number of terms:\n\nArithmetic mean = 784 / 14 = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.",
