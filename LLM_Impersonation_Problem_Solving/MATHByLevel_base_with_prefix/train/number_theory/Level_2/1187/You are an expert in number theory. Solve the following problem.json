    "solution": "We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot13\\cdot(14+98)=\\boxed{56}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7, we first need to determine the smallest and largest two-digit multiples of 7.\n\nThe smallest two-digit multiple of 7 is 14.\nThe largest two-digit multiple of 7 is 98.\n\nTo find the total number of two-digit multiples of 7, we can use the formula:\nTotal number of multiples = (largest multiple - smallest multiple) / 7 + 1\n\nTotal number of multiples = (98 - 14) / 7 + 1 = 14\n\nNext, we find the sum of all two-digit multiples of 7:\nSum = (14 + 98) / 2 * 14 = 56 * 14 = 784\n\nFinally, we find the arithmetic mean by dividing the sum by the total number of multiples:\nArithmetic mean = 784 / 14 = 56\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7 is 56.",
