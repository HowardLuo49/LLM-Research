    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the smallest two-digit number is 10 and the largest is 99. We need to find the values of $n$ such that $2^n$ falls between 10 and 99.\n\nStarting with $2^3=8$, we see that $2^4 = 16$, which is the first number that is greater than or equal to 10. Similarly, $2^6=64$ is the last number that is less than or equal to 99.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the values of $n$ such that $4 \\leq n \\leq 6$. There are 3 possible values for $n$ in this range, namely 4, 5, and 6.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ two-digit numbers that can be written in the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an integer.",
