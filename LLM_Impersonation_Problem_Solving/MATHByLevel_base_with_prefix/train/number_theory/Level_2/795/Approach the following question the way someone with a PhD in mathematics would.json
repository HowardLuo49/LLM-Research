    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $12$ are $2,3,5,7,11$. Since $2$ is the only even prime out of the five primes less than $12$, the answer is $\\frac{1}{5}=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the percentage of prime numbers less than 12 that are divisible by 2, we first need to list out the prime numbers less than 12: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.\n\nAmong these prime numbers, only the number 2 is divisible by 2. Therefore, 1 out of 5 prime numbers less than 12 is divisible by 2.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, we divide the number of prime numbers divisible by 2 (1) by the total number of prime numbers less than 12 (5) and multiply by 100:\n\n(1/5) * 100% = 20%\n\nThus, 20% of the prime numbers less than 12 are divisible by 2.",
