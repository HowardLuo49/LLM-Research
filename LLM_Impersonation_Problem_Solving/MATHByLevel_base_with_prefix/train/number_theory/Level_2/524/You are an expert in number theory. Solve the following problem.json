    "solution": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's say the original number is x.\n\nAccording to the given information, when x is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. This can be represented as:\nx \u2261 2 (mod 7)\n\nWhen three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7, the expression can be written as:\n(3x - 7) \u2261 ? (mod 7)\n\nTo find the remainder, we can substitute x \u2261 2 (mod 7) into the expression:\n(3(2) - 7) \u2261 ?\n(6 - 7) \u2261 ?\n-1 \u2261 6 (mod 7)\n\nTherefore, the remainder when three times the number minus 7 is divided by 7 is 6.",
