    "solution": "If our number is $n$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$.  This tells us that  \\[3n - 7 = n + n + n - 7 \\equiv 6 - 0 \\pmod 7.\\]The remainder is $\\boxed{6}$ when the number is divided by $7.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let the number be denoted by x. According to the given information, x = 7n + 2 for some integer n.\n\nWe are asked to find the remainder when 3x - 7 is divided by 7. Substituting the expression for x, we have:\n\n3(7n + 2) - 7 = 21n + 6 - 7 = 21n - 1\n\nSince 21n is divisible by 7, the remainder when 21n - 1 is divided by 7 is -1 or equivalently 6. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when 3x - 7 is divided by 7 is 6.",
