    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the greatest prime factor of 221?",
    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of 221, we must first factorize 221 into its prime factors. \n\nTo factorize 221, we can start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, 2. However, 221 is not divisible by 2. \n\nNext, we try dividing 221 by the next smallest prime number, 3. Again, 221 is not divisible by 3. \n\nMoving on to the next prime number, 5, we find that 221 is not divisible by 5 either.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that 13 is the smallest prime number that is a factor of 221. Therefore, the prime factorization of 221 is 13 * 17. \n\nThe greatest prime factor of 221 is 17.",
