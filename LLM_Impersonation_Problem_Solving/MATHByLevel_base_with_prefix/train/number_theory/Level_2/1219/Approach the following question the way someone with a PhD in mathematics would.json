    "solution": "Keep up with which days are Thursdays by repeatedly adding 7: November 23, November 30, December 7, December 14, and December 21.  Since December 23 is two days after December 21, it falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine on what day of the week December 23 falls, we can use the fact that there are 7 days in a week and the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, we need to count the number of days between November 23 and December 23. November has 30 days, so there are 7 days from November 23 to November 30. December 1 to December 23 is an additional 22 days. Therefore, there are a total of 7 + 22 = 29 days between the two dates.\n\nSince 29 is equivalent to 1 (mod 7), we can conclude that December 23 falls on the same day of the week as December 23 - 7 = December 16, and December 16 - 7 = December 9, and so on.\n\nDecember 9 is a Saturday, December 16 is also a Saturday, and December 23 falls on a Saturday as well.",
