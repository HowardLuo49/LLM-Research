    "solution": "Keep up with which days are Thursdays by repeatedly adding 7: November 23, November 30, December 7, December 14, and December 21.  Since December 23 is two days after December 21, it falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of days between Thanksgiving (November 23) and December 23, and then find out what day of the week December 23 falls on.\n\n- November has 30 days, so there are 7 days remaining in November after Thanksgiving (November 23). \n- There are 23 days in December until December 23. \n- Adding these together, we have 7 + 23 = 30 days.\n\nSince a week has 7 days, we can divide 30 by 7 to find the remainder:\n30 \u00f7 7 = 4 R 2\n\nThis means that December 23 is 4 weeks and 2 days after Thanksgiving. \nSince Thanksgiving is on a Thursday, and 4 weeks later is 28 days (which is exactly 4 Thursdays), December 23 will also fall on a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, December 23 falls on a Thursday.",
