    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A bag of grapes is to be distributed evenly to 5 kids in a class, and the grapes that are left over will be thrown out. If each student receives the greatest possible number of grapes, what is the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out?",
    "solution": "If we have at least $5$ grapes left, we can give each student one more, so they do not have the greatest possible number.  On the other hand, if we have $4$ grapes left, we cannot give out any more without leaving out at least one student.  So $\\boxed{4}$ grapes is the maximum that we throw out.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the total number of grapes in the bag. If each of the 5 kids receives the greatest possible number of grapes, then each kid would receive x/5 grapes. Since we are distributing the grapes evenly, the number of grapes must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, x must be of the form 5n for some integer n.\n\nIf x = 5n, then the greatest number of grapes that can be thrown out would be the remainder when x is divided by 5, which is 0. Therefore, in this scenario, the greatest possible number of grapes that could be thrown out is 0.",
