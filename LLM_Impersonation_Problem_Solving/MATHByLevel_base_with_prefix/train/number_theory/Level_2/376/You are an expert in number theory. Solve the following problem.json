    "gpt_response": "To express $\\frac{37}{80}$ as a terminating decimal, we need to see if the denominator can be written in the form $2^n \\cdot 5^m$, where n and m are non-negative integers.\n\nSince $80 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^1$, we can rewrite $\\frac{37}{80}$ as $37 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^4 \\cdot 5^1}$.\n\nTo simplify further, we note that $\\frac{1}{2^4 \\cdot 5^1} = \\frac{1}{2^4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{80}$.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{37}{80}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{37}{80} = 37 \\cdot \\frac{1}{80} = 0.4625$. \n\nThus, $\\frac{37}{80}$ as a terminating decimal is $0.4625$.",
