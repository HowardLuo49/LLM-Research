    "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the two integers. We can use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$. Substituting gives that the answer is $36 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two numbers be a and b.\n\nWe know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their greatest common divisor and least common multiple. Therefore, a * b = gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b).\n\nGiven that gcd(a,b) = 6 and lcm(a,b) = 36, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\na * b = 6 * 36\na * b = 216\n\nTherefore, the product of the two numbers is 216.",
