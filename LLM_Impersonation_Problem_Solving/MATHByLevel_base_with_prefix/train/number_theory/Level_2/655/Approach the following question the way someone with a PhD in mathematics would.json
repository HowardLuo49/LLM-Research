    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the total distance Leila covered in ten marathons, we first calculate the total distance in yards. One marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards, so $10$ marathons is $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Converting the miles to yards, we get $260 \\times 1760 = 457600$ yards. Adding the extra $3850$ yards, the total distance covered by Leila in yards is $457600 + 3850 = 461450$ yards.\n\nNow that we have the total distance covered by Leila in yards, we can express this in terms of miles and yards by dividing by $1760$. Doing so, we get $461450 \\div 1760 = 262$ miles with a remainder of $310$ yards. \n\nTherefore, Leila covered $262$ miles and $310$ yards in ten marathons. The value of $y$ is $310$.",
