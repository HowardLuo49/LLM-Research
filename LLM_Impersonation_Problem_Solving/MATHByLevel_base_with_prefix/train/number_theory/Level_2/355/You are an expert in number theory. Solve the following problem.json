    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$, we divide 5 by 7 to get $0.7142857142857143...$. This decimal repeats every 6 digits. \n\nTherefore, the probability of randomly selecting a 4 from the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$. \n\nSo, the probability that the randomly selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
