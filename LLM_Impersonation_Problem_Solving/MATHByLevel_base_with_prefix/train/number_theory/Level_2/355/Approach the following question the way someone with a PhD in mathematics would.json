    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",

Thus, the probability of selecting a 4 as a digit of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability is $\\boxed{0}$.",
