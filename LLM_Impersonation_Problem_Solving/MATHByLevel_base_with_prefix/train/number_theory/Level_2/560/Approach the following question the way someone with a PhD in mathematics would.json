    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of 8/11 by 9 to get 72/99.  The decimal form of 72/99 is $0.\\overline{72}$, and it has a repeating block of length $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the repeating decimal of $8/11$, we can use long division or note that $8/11$ is equivalent to $0.\\overline{72}$. \n\nThe repeating block in the decimal expansion of $8/11$ is $72$. Therefore, the least number of digits in a repeating block of $8/11$ is 2.",
