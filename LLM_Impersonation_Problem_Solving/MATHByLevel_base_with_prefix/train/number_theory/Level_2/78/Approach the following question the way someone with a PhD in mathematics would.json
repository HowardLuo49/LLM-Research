    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There are 54 chips in a box. Each chip is either small or large. If the number of small chips is greater than the number of large chips by a prime number of chips, what is the greatest possible number of large chips?",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the number of small chips and $l$ be the number of large chips. From the given information, we have $s+l=54$ and $s=l+p$ for some prime $p$. Thus, $2l+p=54$. We wish to maximize $l$, so we must minimize $p$. Therefore, we set $p=2$ to get $l=\\boxed{26}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let S be the number of small chips and L be the number of large chips. We are given that S + L = 54 and S = L + p, where p is a prime number. To find the greatest possible number of large chips, we need to maximize L.\n\nSubstitute S = L + p into the equation S + L = 54:\n(L + p) + L = 54\n2L + p = 54\n2L = 54 - p\nL = (54 - p)/2\n\nSince p is a prime number, it must be greater than 1. We want to maximize L, so we want p to be as small as possible. The smallest prime number greater than 1 is 2. Therefore, p = 2.\n\nSubstitute p = 2 into the equation L = (54 - p)/2:\nL = (54 - 2)/2\nL = 26\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of large chips is 26 when there are 28 small chips in the box.",
