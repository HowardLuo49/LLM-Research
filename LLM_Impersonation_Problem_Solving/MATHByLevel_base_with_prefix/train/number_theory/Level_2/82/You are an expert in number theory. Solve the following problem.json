    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the original two-digit integer be $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the digits of the integer.\n\nIf we switch the digits, we get $10b + a$.\n\nAdding 3 to this gives $10b + a + 3$.\n\nTherefore, we have the equation $10b + a + 3 = 2(10a + b)$.\n\nExpanding both sides gives $10b + a + 3 = 20a + 2b$.\n\nSimplifying further gives $8b - 19a = -3$.\n\nTo find the smallest two-digit integer $n$ that satisfies this equation, we can simply start testing values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nFrom the equation $8b - 19a = -3$, we can see that $b$ must be less than 3 (if $b \\geq 3$, then $8b$ will be greater than 19).\n\nTrying $b = 1$ and $b = 2$ gives us $a = 1$ and $a = 2$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the solution is when $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, which gives the smallest two-digit integer $n = 12$.",
