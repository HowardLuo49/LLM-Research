    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the tens digit of the two-digit integer $n$ as $a$ and the units digit as $b$. Then, we can express $n$ as $10a + b$. \n\nSwitching the digits of $n$ and adding 3 results in the following expression:\n\n$10b + a + 3$\n\nAccording to the problem, this expression should be equal to 2n:\n\n$10b + a + 3 = 2(10a + b)$\n\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\n$10b + a + 3 = 20a + 2b$\n\nRearranging terms, we have:\n\n$8b = 19a - 3$\n\nTo find the smallest two-digit integer that satisfies this equation, we can iterate through possible values of $a$ from 1 to 9 and solve for the corresponding values of $b$.
