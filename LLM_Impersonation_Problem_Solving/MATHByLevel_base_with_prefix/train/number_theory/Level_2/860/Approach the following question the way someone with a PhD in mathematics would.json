The digits of a two-digit number $AB$ are reversed to form a second two-digit number, and the lesser of the two-digit numbers is subtracted from the greater. What prime number must be a factor of the difference if $A\\neq B$?",
    "solution": "$AB -BA= 10\\cdot A+B - (10\\cdot B+A)= 9\\cdot A-9\\cdot B=3(3\\cdot A-3\\cdot B)$. If $A\\neq B$, then the difference is a (non-zero) multiple of 3. Thus, $\\boxed{3}$ must be a factor of $AB -BA$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can represent the two-digit numbers $AB$ and $BA$ as $10A+B$ and $10B+A$, respectively. \n\nThe difference between these two numbers is $(10A+B) - (10B+A) = 9(A-B)$. \nSince $A\\neq B$, we know that $A-B\\neq 0$ and $9$ is a factor of the difference. \n\nWe are asked to find the prime factor of the difference. Since $9$ is not a prime number, we need to consider the prime factorization of $9$. \nThe prime factorization of $9$ is $3^2$. \n\nTherefore, the prime factor of the difference will be $\\boxed{3}$.",
