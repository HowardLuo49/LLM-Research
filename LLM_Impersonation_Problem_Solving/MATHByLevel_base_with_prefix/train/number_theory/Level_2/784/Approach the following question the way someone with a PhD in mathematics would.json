    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 0\\pmod 2\\\\\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 4\n\\end{align*} Note that $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \\equiv 0\\pmod 2$, so only $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ and $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ need to be considered. The first few positive solutions of $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$. While the first two do not satisfy $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, luckily $\\boxed{10}$ does!",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that satisfies these conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). \n\nLet's denote the integer we are looking for as x. According to the conditions given: \nx = 0 (mod 2)\nx = 1 (mod 3)\nx = 2 (mod 4)\n\nFrom the first condition, we know that x is an even number. \nFrom the second condition, x = 3k + 1 for some integer k. \nFrom the third condition, x = 4j + 2 for some integer j. \n\nUsing the integer values for k and j, we can express x as:\nx = 3k + 1\nx = 4j + 2.\n\nWe can now use the CRT to find a solution for x. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, we can solve the system of congruences using the extended Euclidean algorithm. \n\nBy solving the system of congruences, we find that x = 10 satisfies all the conditions given, making it the least positive integer that satisfies the stated conditions.",
