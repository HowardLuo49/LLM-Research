    "solution": "For the number to be as large as possible, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible. Therefore, the thousandth digit should be $9$. The other three digits would have to add up to $16-9=7$. The leftmost digit is now the hundredth digit, which should be the largest number possible, $7$. Therefore, the largest four-digit number possible is $\\boxed{9700}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16, we need to first observe that the largest possible digit is 9. \n\nSo, we can start by trying to put 9 in the thousands place, as it is the most significant digit. Then, we can distribute the remaining sum of 16-9=7 among the other three digits. \n\nOne way to maximize the number is to put the next largest digit, which is 7, in the hundreds place. This leaves 7-7=0 for the tens and units place. \n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to 16 is 9790.",
