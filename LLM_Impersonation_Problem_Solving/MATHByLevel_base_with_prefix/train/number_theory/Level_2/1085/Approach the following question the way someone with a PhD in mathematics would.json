    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A number $n$ has $3$ divisors. How many divisors does $n^2$ have?",
    "solution": "If $n$ has $3$ divisors, since it is divisible by both $1$ and $n$, the only possibility for a third unique divisor is $\\sqrt{n}$, which must be prime. Therefore, $n$ is the square of a prime number. As a result, $n^2$ is the fourth power of a prime. Let $n^2 = p^4$ for the prime $p$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ divisors of $p^4$, namely $p^0$, $p^1$, $p^2$, $p^3$, and $p^4$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer with $3$ divisors. Since $n$ has $3$ divisors, it must be in the form of $n=p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. In this case, $n$ would have the divisors $1, p, n=p^2$. \n\nNow, let's consider $n^2=(p^2)^2=p^4$. The divisors of $p^4$ are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$. Therefore, $n^2$ has $5$ divisors, which are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$. \n\nTherefore, if $n$ has $3$ divisors, then $n^2$ will have $5$ divisors.",
