    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The sum of the digits of the year 2004 is 6. What is the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12?",
    "solution": "To find the first year after $2000$ for which the sum of the digits is $12$, take the greatest possible units digit, $9$. $2+9=11$, so take $1$ as the tens digit and $0$ as the hundreds digit. The answer is therefore $\\boxed{2019}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first year after 2000 for which the sum of the digits is 12, we can approach this problem by considering the four-digit numbers starting from 2001 and incrementing by 1 until we find a year that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet the year we are searching for be denoted as ABCD, where A, B, C, and D represent the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively.
