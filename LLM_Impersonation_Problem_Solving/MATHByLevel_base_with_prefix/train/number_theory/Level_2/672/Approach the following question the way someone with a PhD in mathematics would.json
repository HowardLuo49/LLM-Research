    "solution": "Factor out $7^3$ in the given expression $7^4-7^3=7^3(7-1)=7^3\\cdot6=2\\cdot3\\cdot7^3$. Thus, the least prime factor of $7^4-7^3$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$, we first need to simplify the expression. \n\n$7^4 - 7^3 = 7^3(7 - 1) = 7^3 \\times 6 = 7 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 2 = 2^1 \\times 7^3$\n\nNow, we can see that the least prime factor of $7^4 - 7^3$ is 2. This is because 2 is the smallest prime factor present in the expression.",
