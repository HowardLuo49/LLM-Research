    "solution": "We have $1492 = 1500-8 \\equiv -8\\pmod{500}$ and $1999 = 2000-1\\equiv -1\\pmod{500}$.\n\nTherefore, $1492\\cdot 1999\\equiv (-8)\\cdot(-1) \\equiv 8 \\pmod{500}$. The remainder is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $1492\\cdot 1999$ is divided by $500$, we can use the property of remainders in modular arithmetic. \n\nFirst, we find the remainder when each of the numbers $1492$ and $1999$ are divided by $500$. \n$1492 \\equiv -8 \\mod 500$\n$1999 \\equiv -1 \\mod 500$\n\nNow, we can find $1492\\cdot 1999 \\mod 500$ by multiplying the remainders:\n$(-8)(-1) \\equiv 8 \\mod 500$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $1492\\cdot 1999$ is divided by $500$ is $8$.",
