    "solution": "We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \\begin{align*}\n5^0&\\equiv1\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^1&\\equiv5\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^2&\\equiv25\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^3&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^4&\\equiv625\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^5&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\n\\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term.  In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \\[5^n\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{125}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$, we need to consider the pattern of the units digit of powers of 5. The units digit of $5^n$ follows the pattern: 5, 5, 5, 5, ... \n\nTo find the rightmost three digits, we need to consider the powers of 5 modulo 1000. We can simplify $5^{1993} \\pmod{1000}$ as follows:\n\nSince $5^2 = 25$ and the last three digits of $25^n$ is always 625, we can rewrite $5^{1993}$ as:\n$5^{1993} \\equiv 5^{2*996 + 1} \\equiv (5^{2})^{996} * 5 \\equiv 25^{996} * 5 \\equiv 625 * 5 \\equiv 3125 \\equiv 125 \\pmod{1000}$\n\nTherefore, the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$ is 125.",
