    "solution": "The units digit of any positive integer power of 5 is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(Note: this claim may be proved by induction, since the units digit of $5n$ is 5 whenever the units digit of $n$ is 5.)",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of $5^4$ when it is multiplied out, we can consider the pattern of units digits for powers of 5. The units digit of 5 raised to any power is always 5. Therefore, when $5^4$ is multiplied out, the units digit will remain as 5.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 5?: To determine the units digit of $5^4$ when it is multiplied out, we can consider the pattern of units digits for powers of 5. The units digit of 5 raised to any power is always 5. Therefore, when $5^4$ is multiplied out, the units digit will remain as 5.",
