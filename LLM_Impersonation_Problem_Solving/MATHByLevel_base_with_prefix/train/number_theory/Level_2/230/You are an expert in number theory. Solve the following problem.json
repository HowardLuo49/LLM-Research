    "solution": "The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$. $100000_2=1\\cdot2^5=32_{10}$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "For a base ten number to require six digits for its binary representation, it must be in the range of \\(2^5\\) to \\(2^6 - 1\\). This is because a 6-digit binary number can represent values from \\(2^5 = 32\\) to \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\).\n\nTherefore, the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation is \\(2^5 = 32\\).",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 32?: For a base ten number to require six digits for its binary representation, it must be in the range of \\(2^5\\) to \\(2^6 - 1\\). This is because a 6-digit binary number can represent values from \\(2^5 = 32\\) to \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\).\n\nTherefore, the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation is \\(2^5 = 32\\).",
