    "solution": "Let $S = 0.\\overline{3}$. Then $10S = 3.\\overline{3}$. Subtracting the second equation from the first we obtain $9S = 3$, so $S = \\frac13$. The desired denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{3}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get:\n\n$10x = 3.\\overline{3}$\n\nSubtracting the original equation from the second, we have:\n\n$10x - x = 3.\\overline{3} - 0.\\overline{3}$\n\n$9x = 3$\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\nTherefore, the fraction is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so the denominator is $\\boxed{3}$.",
