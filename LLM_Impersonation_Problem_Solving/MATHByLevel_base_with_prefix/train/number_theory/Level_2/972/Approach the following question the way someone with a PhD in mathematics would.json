    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Fifty cards, numbered 1-50, are placed in a box. One card is randomly selected. What is the probability that the number on the card is prime and is a multiple of 7? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "The only multiple of 7 that is prime is 7. Any other multiple of 7 has at least three positive divisors: 1, 7, and itself. Therefore, the probability that the selected number is both prime and a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the probability that the number on the card is both prime and a multiple of 7, we first need to identify which numbers between 1 and 50 meet both of these criteria. \n\nThe prime numbers between 1 and 50 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47. \n\nThe numbers that are multiples of 7 between 1 and 50 are: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. \n\nThe only number that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 7. Therefore, out of the 50 cards, only 1 card meets both criteria. \n\nThus, the probability of selecting a card that is both prime and a multiple of 7 is 1/50. \n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/50.",
