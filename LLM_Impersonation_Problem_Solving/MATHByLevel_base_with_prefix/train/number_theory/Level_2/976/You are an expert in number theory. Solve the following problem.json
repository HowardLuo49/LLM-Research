    "solution": "The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block.  The digit four places later is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of 1/7, we can perform long division:\n\n1/7 = 0.142857142857...\n\nThe decimal representation of 1/7 repeats every 6 digits (142857). Since we are looking for the 100th digit after the decimal point, we can divide 100 by 6 to find the position of the digit we are looking for:\n\n100 \u00f7 6 = 16 remainder 4\n\nThis means that the 100th digit is the 4th digit in the repeating block of digits (142857). Therefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of 1/7 is 8.",
