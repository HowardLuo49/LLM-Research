    "solution": "The decimal representation of 1/7 is $0.\\overline{142857}$.  Since 96 is a multiple of 6, the 96th digit after the decimal point is 7, the digit at the end of the repeating block.  The digit four places later is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7, we need to first calculate the decimal expansion of 1/7. \n\n1/7 can be expressed as a recurring decimal with a repeating sequence of 142857. Therefore, the decimal representation of 1/7 will be 0.142857142857...\n\nSince the repeating sequence of 142857 has 6 digits, we can note that the decimal representation of 1/7 will have groups of 6 digits repeating in the expansion. \n\nTo find the 100th digit after the decimal point, we need to find the position of 100 within the repeating sequence. 100 divided by 6 equals 16 with a remainder of 4. \n\nTherefore, the 100th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of 1/7 falls within the 4th position of the repeating sequence, which is 8. Hence, the answer is 8.",
