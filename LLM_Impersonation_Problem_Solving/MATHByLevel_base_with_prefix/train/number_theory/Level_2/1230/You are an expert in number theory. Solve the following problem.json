    "solution": "The prime numbers are $23$ and $29$. Since $29-23=6$, the mean is $\\frac62=3$ numbers away from $23$ and from $29$. The mean is $\\boxed{26}$. We can also find the mean of $23$ and $29$ with $\\frac{29+23}{2}=\\frac{52}{2}=26$ or just by noticing that the number in the middle of $23$ and $29$ is $26$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to identify which numbers in the list are prime numbers. \n\nPrime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and themselves. In this list, the prime numbers are 23 and 29.\n\nTo find the arithmetic mean of these two prime numbers, we add them together and then divide by 2 (since there are two numbers).\n\nArithmetic mean = (23 + 29) / 2 = 52 / 2 = 26\n\nTherefore, the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list is 26.",
