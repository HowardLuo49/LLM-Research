    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many integers between $500$ and $1000$ contain both the digits $3$ and $4$?",
    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of integers between $500$ and $1000$. \n\nThere are $1000 - 500 + 1 = 501$ integers between $500$ and $1000$. \n\nNext, we need to determine the number of integers between $500$ and $1000$ that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$. \n\nWe can approach this by considering the different positions that the digits $3$ and $4$ can be in. \n\nIf the integer contains both the digits $3$ and $4$, they can either be in the hundreds place and the tens place, or in the tens place and the units place. \n\nFor the first case, the hundreds place can be filled in $9$ ways (any digit from $1$ to $9$ except for $3$) and the tens place can be filled in $1$ way (with the digit $4$). The units place can then be filled in $10$ ways (any digit from $0$ to $9). \n\nThis gives us a total of $9 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 90$ integers where the digits $3$ and $4$ are in the hundreds and tens places. \n\nFor the second case, the tens place can be filled in $1$ way (with the digit $3$), the units place can be filled in $1$ way (with the digit $4$), and the hundreds place can be filled in $5$ ways (any digit from $5$ to $9). \n\nThis gives us a total of $1 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 5$ integers where the digits $3$ and $4$ are in the tens and units places. \n\nTherefore, the total number of integers between $500$ and $1000$ that contain both the digits $3$ and $4$ is $90 + 5 = 95$.",
