    "solution": "Terminating decimals can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$. So, we try to get our fraction in this form: $$\\frac{11}{125} = \\frac{11}{5^3} = \\frac{11}{5^3} \\cdot \\frac{2^3}{2^3} = \\frac{11\\cdot2^3}{10^3} = \\frac{88}{1000} = \\boxed{0.088}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the terminating decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$, we must first express it as a fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10. \n\nWe can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 8 to get $\\frac{88}{1000}$. This is because $125 = 5^3$ and $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, so $125$ shares a common factor of $5$ with $10$.\n\nNow, we can simplify $\\frac{88}{1000}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8 to get $\\frac{11}{125}$. \n\nThus, the terminating decimal expansion of $\\frac{11}{125}$ is $\\boxed{0.088}$.",
