    "solution": "Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3\\cdot 3^2$.  A positive integer is a factor of 72 if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are less than or equal to the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 72.  Also, a positive integer is a perfect cube if and only if every exponent is a multiple of 3.  Therefore, in forming a perfect cube factor of 72, we have 2 choices for the exponent of $2$ (either 0 or 3) and only 1 choice for the exponent of 3 (namely 0).  There are $2\\cdot 1=\\boxed{2}$ ways to make these choices.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive factors of 72 that are perfect cubes, we first need to factorize 72.\n\n72 = 2^3 * 3^2 \n\nA perfect cube factor of 72 can be written in the form of (2^(3n))*(3^(3m)), where n and m are non-negative integers.\n\nFor a factor to be a perfect cube, the exponents of 2 and 3 in its prime factorization must be multiples of 3. \n\nSo, for the factor to be a perfect cube, we have the following possibilities for the exponents of 2 and 3:\n\n2^0 * 3^0  (which corresponds to the number 1)\n\n2^3 * 3^0  (which corresponds to the number 8)\n\n2^0 * 3^3  (which corresponds to the number 27)\n\n2^3 * 3^3  (which corresponds to the number 216)\n\nTherefore, the positive factors of 72 that are perfect cubes are 1, 8, 27, and 216.
