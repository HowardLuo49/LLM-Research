    "solution": "The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3. The sum of their reciprocals is $1/1+1/6+1/2+1/3=6/6+1/6+3/6+2/6=12/6=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6, we first need to list out the factors of 6. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nNow, we take the reciprocals of each of these factors:\n\n1/1 = 1\n1/2 = 1/2\n1/3 = 1/3\n1/6 = 1/6\n\nAdding these reciprocals together gives us:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6\n\nTo find a common denominator, we can express each fraction in terms of 6:\n\n1 = 6/6\n1/2 = 3/6\n1/3 = 2/6\n1/6 = 1/6\n\nNow, adding the fractions together gives us:\n\n6/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 + 1/6 = 12/6 = 2\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.",
