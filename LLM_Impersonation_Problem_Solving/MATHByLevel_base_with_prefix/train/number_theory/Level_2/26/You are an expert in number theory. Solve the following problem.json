    "solution": "The natural-number factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3. The sum of their reciprocals is $1/1+1/6+1/2+1/3=6/6+1/6+3/6+2/6=12/6=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of these factors is:\n1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.167 = 2\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the natural-number factors of 6 is 2.",
