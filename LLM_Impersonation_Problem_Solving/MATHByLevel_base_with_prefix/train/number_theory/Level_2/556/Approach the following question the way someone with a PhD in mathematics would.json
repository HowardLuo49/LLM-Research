    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old.",
    "gpt_response": "Let Jane's current age be represented by x. \nGiven that one year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, we have (x-1) = y^2, where y is an integer. \nSimilarly, given that one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube, we have (x+1) = z^3, where z is an integer. \n\nNow, we can simplify the equations to get:\n1) x = y^2 + 1\n2) x = z^3 - 1\n\nFrom equations 1 and 2, we have y^2 + 1 = z^3 - 1. \nRearranging the equation gives: y^2 = z^3 - 2\n\nAt this point, we may recognize that this problem is related to an unsolved mathematical problem called the Beal Conjecture, which states that if A^x + B^y = C^z, where A, B, C, x, y, z are positive integers and x, y, z are greater than 2, then A, B, and C must have a common prime factor. \n\nGiven this complexity, we can conclude that there are no integers y and z such that y^2 = z^3 - 2.
