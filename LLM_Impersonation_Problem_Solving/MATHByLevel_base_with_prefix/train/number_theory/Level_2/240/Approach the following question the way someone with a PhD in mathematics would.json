    "solution": "When you divide 40 days in a week by 7 days, you get a remainder of 5.  Five days from Tuesday is $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week that is 40 days from Tuesday, one would first recognize that the days of the week form a cycle of 7 consecutive days. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by finding the remainder when 40 is divided by 7.\n\n40 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 5 with a remainder of 5. This indicates that 40 days from Tuesday will be 5 days beyond the next Tuesday in the cycle. Since Tuesday is the second day of the week, moving 5 days beyond it would result in Sunday.\n\nTherefore, 40 days from Tuesday will fall on a Sunday.",
