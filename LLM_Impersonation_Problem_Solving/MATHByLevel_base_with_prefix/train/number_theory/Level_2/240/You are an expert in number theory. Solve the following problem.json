    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder when 40 is divided by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\n40 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 5. This means that 40 days from Tuesday will be 5 days ahead in the week.\n\nStarting from Tuesday, count 5 days ahead, we get:\n\nTuesday -> Wednesday -> Thursday -> Friday -> Saturday -> Sunday\n\nTherefore, 40 days from Tuesday will be a Sunday.",
