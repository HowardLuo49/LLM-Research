    "solution": "We can write the condition on $t$ as $$11\\cdot t \\equiv 36\\pmod{100}.$$Then, multiplying both sides by $9$, we have $$99\\cdot t \\equiv 324 \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}.$$The left side, $99t$, is congruent modulo $100$ to $-t$, so we have $$-t \\equiv 24\\pmod{100}$$and therefore $$t \\equiv -24\\pmod{100}.$$The unique two-digit positive solution is $t=-24+100=\\boxed{76}$. Indeed, we can check that $11\\cdot 76 = 836$, which does end in $36$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the unique two-digit integer $t$ such that the last two digits of $11t$ are 36, we first note that multiplying a number by 11 is equivalent to adding the number to itself with a zero added between the digits. Therefore, we can write $11t = t + t \\times 10 = 11t$.\n\nWe are given that the last two digits of $11t$ are 36. This implies that $11t$ is of the form $100k + 36$, where $k$ is an integer.
