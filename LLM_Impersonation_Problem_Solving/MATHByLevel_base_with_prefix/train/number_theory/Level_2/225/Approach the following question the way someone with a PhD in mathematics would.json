    "solution": "Dividing using long division, we find that $2007=81\\cdot24 + 63$, so the remainder is $\\boxed{63}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can approach this problem by using the division algorithm. By dividing $2007$ by $81$, we get:\n\n$$2007 = 81 \\times 24 + 63$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2007$ is divided by $81$ is $63$.",
