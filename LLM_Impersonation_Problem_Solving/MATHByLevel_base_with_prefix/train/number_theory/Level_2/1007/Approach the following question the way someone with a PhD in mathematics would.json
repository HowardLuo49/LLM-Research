    "gpt_response": "To convert a base-eight number to a base-ten number, we must first write out the given number in terms of its digits and positions. The base-eight number 31 can be represented as 3*8^1 + 1*8^0. Calculating this expression gives us 3*8 + 1*1 = 24 + 1 = 25. Therefore, the base-ten number represented by the base-eight number 31 is 25.",
