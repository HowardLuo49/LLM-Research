    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not a multiple of 16, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40.\n\nThe prime factorization of 30 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\nThe prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 \u00d7 5\n\nThe LCM of 30 and 40 is 2^3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 120\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 is 120. \n\nTo ensure that the number is not a multiple of 16, we must make sure it doesn't have any factor of 2 to the fourth power or higher.
