    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of 3 cent stamps and y be the number of 4 cent stamps.\n\nThe total value of the stamps can be represented by the equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 33\n\nWe want to find the least number of stamps that satisfy this equation. To do this, we can start by examining possible values for x and y.\n\nSince we are looking for the least number of stamps, we can start with the smallest values for x and y:\n\nx = 1, y = 8\n3(1) + 4(8) = 3 + 32 = 35\n\nx = 2, y = 7\n3(2) + 4(7) = 6 + 28 = 34\n\nx = 3, y = 6\n3(3) + 4(6) = 9 + 24 = 33\n\nTherefore, the least number of stamps Bryan can combine to get 33 cents is 3 (3 cent stamps) and 6 (4 cent stamps).",
