    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Bryan has some 3 cent stamps and some 4 cent stamps. What is the least number of stamps he can combine so the value of the stamps is 33 cents?",
    "solution": "Let $c$ and $f$ be the number of 3 cent stamps and 4 cent stamps that Bryan can use, respectively. We have $3c+4f=33$. To minimize $c+f$, we must minimize the number of 3 cent stamps used. Since $f$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=3$, in which case $4f=33-3c=33-3\\times3=24\\Rightarrow f=6$. The least value is therefore $c+f=3+6=\\boxed{9}$ stamps.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of 3 cent stamps and y be the number of 4 cent stamps that Bryan combines. We want to minimize the number of stamps, so we can formulate the problem as the following linear Diophantine equation:\n\n3x + 4y = 33\n\nThis is a classic problem in number theory and can be solved using techniques such as the Euclidean algorithm or modular arithmetic. \n\nWe can see that this equation has an infinite number of integer solutions. One particular solution is x = 9, y = 6. This solution gives us the minimum number of stamps needed to make 33 cents, which is 15 stamps. \n\nThus, Bryan can combine 9 3-cent stamps and 6 4-cent stamps to make a total of 15 stamps worth 33 cents with the minimum number of stamps.",
