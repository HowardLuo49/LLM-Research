    "solution": "The product of the three integers is equivalent in modulo 5 to the product of the modulo 5 residues of the three integers.  We multiply these residues to find the remainder: $$ 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "This problem can be solved using modular arithmetic. \n\nLet the three positive integers be denoted as a, b, and c. We are given that when each of these integers is divided by 5, the remainders are 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n\nUsing modular arithmetic, we can represent this information as:\na \u2261 1 (mod 5)\nb \u2261 2 (mod 5)\nc \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n\nNow, we are asked to find the remainder when the product of these three numbers is divided by 5. This can be represented mathematically as:\n(a * b * c) \u2261 x (mod 5)\n\nTo find this remainder, we can consider the remainders of a, b, and c when divided by 5. We can write a, b, and c as:\na = 5k + 1\nb = 5m + 2\nc = 5n + 3\n\nWhere k, m, and n are integers.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the product:\n(a * b * c) = (5k + 1) * (5m + 2) * (5n + 3)\n= (25kmn + 15kn + 10mk + 6mn + 5k + 3m + 2n + 1)\n\nNow, when we divide this expression by 5, all terms with 5 in them will have a remainder of 0. Therefore, the remainder when (a * b * c) is divided by 5 will be the remainder of the term 1, which is 1.\n\nHence, the remainder when the product of the three positive integers is divided by 5 is 1.",
