    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?",
    "solution": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive multiples of 5 less than 100 with a units digit of 5, we can consider the general form of any multiple of 5 with a units digit of 5:\n\nn = 10k + 5\n\nwhere k is a non-negative integer. Since we are looking for multiples less than 100, we have k < 10. Now we can substitute k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 into the equation and find that n takes on the values 5, 15, 25, ..., 95. This gives us a total of 10 positive multiples of 5 less than 100 that have a units digit of 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 10 positive multiples of 5 less than 100 that have a units digit of 5.",
