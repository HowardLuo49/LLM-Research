    "solution": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 2\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nd &\\equiv 8\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &\\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 20\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$. This remainder is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four positive integers be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$.
