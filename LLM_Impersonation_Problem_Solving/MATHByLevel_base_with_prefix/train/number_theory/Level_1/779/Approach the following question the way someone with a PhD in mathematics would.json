    "solution": "We can call the four integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ $c$, and $d$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 2\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 6\\pmod{11}, \\\\\nd &\\equiv 8\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c+d &\\equiv 2+4+6+8 \\\\\n&\\equiv 20\\pmod{11}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c+d$ has the same remainder as $20$ upon division by $11$. This remainder is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we note that when any integer $n$ is divided by $11$, the possible remainders are $0, 1, 2, ..., 10$. \n\nGiven that the remainders when the four positive integers are divided by $11$ are $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$, we can express the four integers as $11a + 2$, $11b + 4$, $11c + 6$, and $11d + 8$ for some integers $a, b, c, d$.\n\nWe want to find the remainder when the sum of the four integers is divided by $11$.
