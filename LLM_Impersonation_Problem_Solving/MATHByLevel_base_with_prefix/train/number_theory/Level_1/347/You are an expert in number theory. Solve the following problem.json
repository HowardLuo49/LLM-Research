    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6, we need to find the least common multiple of 3 and 6.\n\nThe LCM of 3 and 6 is 6, because it is the smallest number that is divisible by both 3 and 6.\n\nTo find the greatest three-digit number divisible by 6, we need to find the largest multiple of 6 that is less than 1000. The largest multiple of 6 less than 1000 is 996.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible three-digit number that is divisible by both 3 and 6 is 996.",
