Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over. What is the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over?",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ represent the number of candy pieces in each bag. Since we are distributing candy evenly among nine bags, we can write this as:\n\n$x = 9n + r$\n\nWhere $r$ represents the number of pieces left over. We are looking to maximize $r$, so we want to find the largest possible value for $r$. To do this, we need to consider the possible values for $n$.\n\nSince every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces, $n$ must be an integer less than the total number of pieces of candy. Therefore, $n$ can take values from 1 to $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{9}\\right\\rfloor$.\n\nTo maximize $r$, we want to find the largest possible remainder when $x$ is divided by 9. This maximum remainder occurs when $x$ is one less than a multiple of 9. Therefore, the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over is 8.",
