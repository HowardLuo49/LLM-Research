Grady distributed $x$ pieces of candy evenly among nine Halloween bags such that every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, but some candy was left over. What is the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over?",
    "solution": "Grady distributes his candy in groups of 9 until he no longer has any groups left.  The largest number of possible pieces left is $\\boxed{8},$ since if he has more than 8 he can distribute another group of 9.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over. Since Grady distributed $x$ candies evenly among the nine bags, it means that $x$ is divisible by 9. \n\nLet $x = 9m$, where $m$ is an integer. \n\nSince every bag received the greatest possible number of whole pieces of candy, we can write $m = 9a + n$, where $a$ is an integer representing the number of whole pieces of candy in each bag.\n\nThus, we have $x = 9(9a + n) = 81a + 9n$.\n\nSince $x = 9m$, we have $81a + 9n = 9m$.\n\nDividing both sides by 9 gives $9a + n = m$.\n\nTherefore, $n$ is the remainder when $m$ is divided by 9.\n\nThe greatest possible value of $n$ occurs when $m = 9 - 1 = 8$ (since $m$ must be less than 9), which gives $n = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible number of pieces that could have been left over is $\\boxed{8}$.",
