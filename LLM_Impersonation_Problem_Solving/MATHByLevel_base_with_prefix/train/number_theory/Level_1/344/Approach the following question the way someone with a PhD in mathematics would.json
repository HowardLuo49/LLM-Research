    "solution": "Since 19 is close to 20 and $20\\cdot50=1000$, we consider \\[19\\cdot50=950.\\] From here we skip-count by 19s: \\[950,969,988,1007,\\ldots\\] The largest three-digit multiple of 19 is $\\boxed{988}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest three-digit multiple of 19, we can use the fact that the largest three-digit number is 999. We want to find the largest multiple of 19 that is less than or equal to 999.\n\nTo do this, we divide 999 by 19 and find that it goes in 52 times with a remainder of 7. Therefore, the largest multiple of 19 less than or equal to 999 is 52 * 19 = 988. Therefore, the greatest three-digit multiple of 19 is 988.",
