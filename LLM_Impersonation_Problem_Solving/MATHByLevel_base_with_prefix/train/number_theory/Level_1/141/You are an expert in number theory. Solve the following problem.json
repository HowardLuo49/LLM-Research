    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. A math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the total number of students be $n$. We can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1) $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ (when sitting in rows of $7$)\n2) $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ (when sitting in rows of $5$)\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $n = 7k + 3$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$7k + 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$\n\nThis simplifies to $2k \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. Solving this congruence, we find $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nTherefore, $k = 5m + 4$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this back into $n = 7k + 3$, we get:\n\n$n = 7(5m + 4) + 3 = 35m + 31$\n\nSince $n < 40$, the only possible value for $m$ is $0$. Thus, $n = 31$.\n\nTherefore, there are $31$ students in this class.",
