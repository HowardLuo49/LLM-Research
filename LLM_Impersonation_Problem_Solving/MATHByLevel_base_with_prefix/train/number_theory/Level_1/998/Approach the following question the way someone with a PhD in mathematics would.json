    "solution": "Notice that we can pair many of these terms: \\[1+7=2+6=3+5=8,\\]so the remainder we want is the same as the remainder when $4+9+10$ is divided by 8.  We also see that this is the remainder when  \\[4+1+2=7\\]is divided by 8, so the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is divided by 8, we can first find the sum of these numbers:\n\n$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\dots + 9 + 10 = \\frac{10 \\cdot (1 + 10)}{2} = 55$.\n\nSince 55 divided by 8 is 6 with a remainder of 7, the remainder when the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10 is divided by 8 is 7.",
