    "solution": "We can use the Division Theorem ($a=bq+r$).  $74 \\div 7 = 10 R 4$, so $74 = 10 \\times 7 + 4$.  We subtract 1 to get a remainder of 3, so 74 - 1 = $\\boxed{73}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, we need to find the largest integer that satisfies the congruence:\n\nx \u2261 3 (mod 7)\n\nIn other words, we are looking for the largest integer x such that x is congruent to 3 modulo 7. \n\nTo find this integer, we can start by finding the multiples of 7 that are closest to, but less than, 74. The multiple of 7 that is less than 74 is 70. Adding 3 to this number gives us:\n\n70 + 3 = 73\n\nTherefore, the largest integer less than 74 that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 is 73.",
