    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7?",
    "solution": "We can start from 9 and keeping adding 10 until we reach an integer divisible by 7. It turns out that 9, 19, 29, and 39 are all not divisible by 7, but 49 is divisible by 7. Therefore, $\\boxed{49}$ is the smallest integer that ends in a 9 and is divisible by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7, we need to consider the properties of numbers that are divisible by 7. \n\nA number is divisible by 7 if the difference between twice the last digit and the rest of the number is divisible by 7. In this case, we are looking for a number that ends in 9, so we can write it in the form 10k + 9, where k is an integer. \n\nTo determine the smallest k that satisfies the condition, we need to find the smallest k such that (2*9 - k) mod 7 = 0. This simplifies to (18 - k) mod 7 = 0, which means that k must be equal to 4. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that ends in 9 and is divisible by 7 is 49.",
