    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The integer $m$ is between $30$ and $80$ and is a multiple of $6$. When $m$ is divided by $8,$ the remainder is $2$. Similarly, when $m$ is divided by $5,$ the remainder is $2$. What is the value of $m$?",
    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to express the information given in the problem mathematically. Let $m = 6k$ where $k$ is an integer. We also know that $m$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8, so we can express this as $6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. This implies that $6k = 8n + 2$ for some integer $n$.\n\nSimilarly, we know that $m$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, so we can express this as $6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. This implies that $6k = 5m + 2$ for some integer $m$.\n\nNow we can solve the system of congruences. To do this, we can substitute $8n + 2$ for $6k$ in the second congruence, giving us $8n + 2 = 5m + 2$. Simplifying, we get $8n = 5m$. \n\nSince $m$ is between 30 and 80, we can test values of $m$ that are multiples of 6 within this range to find the appropriate value of $m$ that satisfies the conditions given. Here, we can see that $m = 60$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. \n\nTherefore, the value of $m$ is 60.",
