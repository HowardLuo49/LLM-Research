    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. The integer $m$ is between $30$ and $80$ and is a multiple of $6$. When $m$ is divided by $8,$ the remainder is $2$. Similarly, when $m$ is divided by $5,$ the remainder is $2$. What is the value of $m$?",
    "solution": "According to the problem statement, we have the system of linear congruences \\begin{align*}\nm &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\\\\nm &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*} It follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem that $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod{40}$. The only number that satisfies this criterion for $30 \\le m \\le 80$ is $m = \\boxed{42}$, which is indeed divisible by $6$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $m = 6k$ for some integer $k$. We know that when $m$ is divided by 8, the remainder is 2. This can be expressed as $6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. Since $6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{8}$, we have $6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\implies 6 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8} \\implies 36 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$. Therefore, $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nSimilarly, we know that when $m$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 2. This can be expressed as $6k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. We can simplify this congruence by dividing by 2, which gives $3k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Checking the possible values of $k$ modulo 5, we find that $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the integer $m = 6k$ must satisfy $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$ and $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees that there is a unique solution modulo $8 \\cdot 5 = 40$. This solution is $k \\equiv 16 \\pmod{40}$. Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $16, 56$. Since $30 \\leq m \\leq 80$, the only possible value for $m$ is $6 \\cdot 56 = \\boxed{336}$.",
