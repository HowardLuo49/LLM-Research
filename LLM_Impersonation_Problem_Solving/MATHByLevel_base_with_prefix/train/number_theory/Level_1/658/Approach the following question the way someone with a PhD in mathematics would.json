    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If 25,197,624 hot dogs are packaged in sets of 4, how many will be left over?",
    "solution": "We look for the remainder when $25,197,624$ is divided by $4$. We could manually divide to see that $4$ divides evenly into $25,197,624$ for a remainder of $0$, but the quicker way is to know the divisibility rule for $4$. If the last two digits of the number form a multiple of $4$, then the number itself is divisible by $4$.  In this case, $24$ is a multiple of $4$, so $25,197,624$ is also a multiple of $4$. That means $\\boxed{0}$ hot dogs will be left over.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of hot dogs that will be left over when 25,197,624 hot dogs are packaged in sets of 4, we can use modular arithmetic. \n\nLet's denote the total number of hot dogs as N = 25,197,624 and the number of hot dogs in each set as k = 4. We want to find the remainder when N is divided by k.\n\nUsing the modulo operation, we can calculate the remainder as follows:\n\nN mod k = 25,197,624 mod 4\n\nSince 25,197,624 is a large number, we can simplify the calculation by looking at the divisibility rule for 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4. Therefore, we can ignore all digits except for the last two digits of 25,197,624, which are 24. \n\n24 is divisible by 4, so the remainder when 25,197,624 is divided by 4 is 0. This means that all 25,197,624 hot dogs can be evenly divided into sets of 4 without any hot dogs being left over.",
