    "solution": "The least common multiple of these integers is $4\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\\boxed{61}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find a two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers and then add 1 to it.\n\nThe LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60. Adding 1 to 60 gives us 61.\n\nTherefore, the two-digit positive integer that is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 61.",
