    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A total of 180 marbles (gray, white, and black) are placed in a line. The first five are gray, followed by four white, followed by three black, followed by five gray, followed by four white, followed by three black,.... If this pattern continues, what is the color of the 158th marble in this line?",
    "solution": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to recognize the pattern that emerges with the placement of the marbles in the line. From the given sequence, we can see that the pattern repeats every 12 marbles - 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black. \n\nWe need to find the color of the 158th marble in the line. To do this, we divide 158 by 12, which equals 13 with a remainder of 2. This tells us that the 158th marble is in the second repetition of the pattern. \n\nIn the second repetition, the 2nd position corresponds to a white marble, as the pattern is 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black. Therefore, the 158th marble in this line is white.",
