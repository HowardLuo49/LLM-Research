    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be a prime number. Then, the value we are looking for, $q$, can be represented as:\n\n$q = 1 + 11p$\n\nSince we are given that $q$ is also a prime number, we need to find a prime number $p$ such that $q$ is also a prime number.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by testing prime numbers starting from the smallest prime number, which is 2, and moving upwards. \n\nLet's start with $p=2$:\n$q = 1 + 11(2) = 23$\n\nSince 23 is a prime number, $p=2$ satisfies the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the value of $q$ is $23$.",
