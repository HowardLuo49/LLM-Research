    "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the definition of a remainder when dividing a number by another number. When we divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. This can be written as $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. \n\nSince $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30, we can write $n = 8k + 5$ for some integer $k$. We know that $20 < n < 30$, so we can substitute the possible values of $n$ into the equation $n = 8k + 5$ and see which one satisfies the conditions.\n\nIf we substitute $n = 23$, we have $23 = 8k + 5$, which simplifies to $k = 2$. Since $k$ must be an integer, 23 is a valid value for $n$ that satisfies the conditions given.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is 23.",
