    "solution": "We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\\boxed{29}$.\n\nOR\n\nWhen we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first list out the prime numbers between 20 and 30: 23, 29.\n\nNow, let's test each of these numbers to see if dividing them by 8 leaves a remainder of 5.\n\n23 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 7. This is not 5.\n\n29 divided by 8 is 3 with a remainder of 5. This fits the condition given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is 29.",
