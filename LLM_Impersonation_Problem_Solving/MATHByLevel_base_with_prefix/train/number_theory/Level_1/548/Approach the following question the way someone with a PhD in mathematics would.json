    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.  What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again, we need to consider the integers incrementally and calculate the sum of their digits until we find a year that satisfies the condition. \n\nLet's start with the year 2011. The sum of the digits in 2011 is $2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\nMoving on to the year 2012, we have $2 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 5$.\nContinuing this pattern, the sum of the digits in years 2013, 2014, and 2015 are $6, 7,$ and $8$, respectively. \n\nIt is evident that the sum of the digits of each year after 2010 increases by $1$ with each year. Therefore, we need to find the year where the sum of the digits is $3$ again. By observation, we see that the next occurrence will be in the year 2100, where $2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3$. \n\nSo the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again is 2100.",

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No, the final solution obtained is not 2100, it is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2022, as $2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6$.",
