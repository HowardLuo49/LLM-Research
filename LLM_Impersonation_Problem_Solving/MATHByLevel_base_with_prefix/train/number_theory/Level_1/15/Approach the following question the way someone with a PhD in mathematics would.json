    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Abigail, Beatrice, and Carson combine their eggs to sell them at the market. If Abigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs, and if eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold?",
    "solution": "The remainder when $37+49+14$ is divided by $12$ is the same as the remainder when the congruences of each number mod 12 are summed and then divided by 12. In other words, since we have \\begin{align*}\n37 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}\\\\\n49 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{12} \\\\\n14 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}then therefore, $37+49+14 \\equiv1+1+2 \\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many eggs will be left over if all cartons are sold, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs. \n\nAbigail has 37 eggs, Beatrice has 49 eggs, and Carson has 14 eggs. The total number of eggs is 37 + 49 + 14 = 100 eggs.\n\nSince eggs can only be sold in cartons of 12, we need to divide the total number of 100 eggs by 12 to determine how many cartons can be sold and how many eggs will be left over.\n\n100 \u00f7 12 = 8 with a remainder of 4. \n\nTherefore, if all cartons are sold, there will be 4 eggs left over.",
