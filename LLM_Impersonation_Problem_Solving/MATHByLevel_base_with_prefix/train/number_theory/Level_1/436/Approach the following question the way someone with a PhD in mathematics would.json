    "solution": "Since 25 divides evenly into 2000 and 2007 is 7 more than 2000, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we first need to determine how many times 25 divides into 2007. This can be done by dividing 2007 by 25 using long division.\n\n2007 \u00f7 25 = 80 with a remainder of 7\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
