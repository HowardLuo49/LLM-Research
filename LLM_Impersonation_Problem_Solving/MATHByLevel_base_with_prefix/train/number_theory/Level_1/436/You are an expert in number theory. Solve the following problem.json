    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. What is the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25?",
    "solution": "Since 25 divides evenly into 2000 and 2007 is 7 more than 2000, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we can use the division algorithm. \n\n2007 divided by 25 gives 80 as the quotient, and 7 as the remainder.\n\nSo, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 7?: To find the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25, we can use the division algorithm. \n\n2007 divided by 25 gives 80 as the quotient, and 7 as the remainder.\n\nSo, the remainder when 2007 is divided by 25 is 7.",
