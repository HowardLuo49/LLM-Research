    "solution": "If $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, then $n+6$ will also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. If we keep adding 6 to $n$, we still have a remainder of 1. We can write $2010 = 6 \\cdot 335$, so once we add 6 to $n$ 335 times, we will get that $n+2010$ has a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$ when it is divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "Since $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, we can express $n$ as $n = 6k + 1$ for some integer $k$. \n\nWhen we add 2010 to $n$, we get $n + 2010 = 6k + 1 + 2010 = 6k + 2011$.\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6. We can rewrite $6k + 2011$ as $6k + 6 \\times 335 + 1$. This shows that $n + 2010$ is one more than a multiple of 6, and so the remainder when $n + 2010$ is divided by 6 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
