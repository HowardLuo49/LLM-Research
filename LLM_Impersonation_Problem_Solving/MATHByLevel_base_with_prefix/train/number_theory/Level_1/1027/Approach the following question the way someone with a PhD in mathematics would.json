    "solution": "The prime numbers less than $10$ are $2,3,5,7$, so the sum is $2+3+5+7=\\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of prime numbers less than 10, we first identify the prime numbers in this range: 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then, we simply add them together: \n\n2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. \n\nTherefore, the sum of prime numbers less than 10 is 17.",
