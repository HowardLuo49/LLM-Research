    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "To distribute the $20$ pieces of candy equally among $3$ sisters, each sister would ideally receive $\\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67$ pieces. Since each sister cannot receive a decimal number of pieces, we need to find the least number of pieces Daniel should take away to make the distribution equal.\n\nWe can round down each sister's share to $6$ pieces, resulting in each sister receiving $6$ pieces and thus distributing $18$ pieces in total. Therefore, Daniel should take away $20 - 18 = \\boxed{2}$ pieces of candy to distribute them equally among his $3$ sisters.",
