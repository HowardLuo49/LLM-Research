What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "gpt_response": "In order to distribute the candy equally among the 3 sisters, each sister should receive $\\frac{20}{3} = 6\\frac{2}{3}$ pieces of candy. Since it is not possible to give a fraction of a piece of candy, Daniel must take away the remainder of the quotient, which is $2$ pieces of candy. Therefore, the least number of pieces he should take away is $\\boxed{2}$.",
