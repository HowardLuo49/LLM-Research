    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can rewrite the three positive integers as:\n$$\na = 24k_1 + 10, \\quad b = 24k_2 + 4, \\quad c = 24k_3 + 12\n$$\nwhere $a, b, c$ are the three positive integers and $k_1, k_2, k_3$ are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of these integers:\n$$\na + b + c = 24k_1 + 10 + 24k_2 + 4 + 24k_3 + 12\n$$\n$$\n= 24(k_1 + k_2 + k_3) + 26\n$$\n\nTherefore, when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
