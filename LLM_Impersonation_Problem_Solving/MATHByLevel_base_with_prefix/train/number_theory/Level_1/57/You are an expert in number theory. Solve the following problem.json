    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 10\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 4\\pmod{24}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 12\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 10+4+12 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{24}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $24$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",

We can write the given information as:\n$a\\equiv 10 \\pmod{24}$\n$b\\equiv 4 \\pmod{24}$\n$c\\equiv 12 \\pmod{24}$\n\nThis means $a = 24k_1 + 10$, $b = 24k_2 + 4$, and $c = 24k_3 + 12$ for some integers $k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$.\n\nThen the sum of the three integers is $a + b + c = 24k_1 + 10 + 24k_2 + 4 + 24k_3 + 12 = 24(k_1 + k_2 + k_3) + 26$.\n\nSince $26$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $24$, the remainder when the sum of the three integers is divided by $24$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
