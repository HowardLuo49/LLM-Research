    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3?",
    "solution": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3, we first need to determine what remainder 412 leaves when divided by 3. \n\nThe remainder can be calculated by taking the original number (412) modulo the divisor (3). \n\n412 mod 3 = 1 \n\nTherefore, 412 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. To make the sum a multiple of 3, we need to add the next integer after 412 that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. \n\nThe next integer after 412 is 413. \n\n413 mod 3 = 2 \n\nSo, adding 413 to 412 will result in a multiple of 3. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3 is 413.",
