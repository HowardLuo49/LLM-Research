    "solution": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3, we need to find the remainder when 412 is divided by 3.\n\nFirst, we calculate the remainder of 412 when divided by 3:\n412 \u00f7 3 = 137 with a remainder of 1\n\nSince the remainder is 1, we need to add 2 to 412 to make it a multiple of 3:\n412 + 2 = 414\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3 is 2.",
