    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $n$ for which the four-digit number $712n$ is divisible by 18, we need to first understand the properties of divisibility by 18. \n\nA number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9, as 18 can be factored into 2 x 9. A number is divisible by 2 if its units digit is even, and it is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nFor the given four-digit number $712n$, we know that n is the units digit. In order for $712n$ to be divisible by 2, n must be even. This implies that n can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nTo determine the value of n for which $712n$ is also divisible by 9, we need to consider the sum of the digits $7 + 1 + 2 + n$. This sum must be divisible by 9. \n\nSince we want a four-digit number, the possible values for n are 2, 4, 6, or 8. By trial and error, we can determine that the sum of the digits is divisible by 9 when n = 4. \n\nTherefore, the four-digit number $7124$, where n = 4, is divisible by 18.",
