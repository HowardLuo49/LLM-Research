    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. For what value of $n$ is the four-digit number $712n$, with units digit $n$, divisible by 18?",
    "solution": "We know that $18=9\\cdot2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $7+1+2+n$, or $10+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $n=18-10=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even. Since the units digit in this case is $n$, $n$ must be even.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. \nThe sum of the digits in the number $712n$ is $7 + 1 + 2 + n = 10 + n$.\n\nSo, we need to find the value of $n$ that makes $10 + n$ divisible by 9.\n\nThe smallest even number that makes $10 + n$ divisible by 9 is $n = 8$, because then $10 + 8 = 18$, which is divisible by 9.\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes the four-digit number $712n$ divisible by 18 is $n = \\boxed{8}$.",
