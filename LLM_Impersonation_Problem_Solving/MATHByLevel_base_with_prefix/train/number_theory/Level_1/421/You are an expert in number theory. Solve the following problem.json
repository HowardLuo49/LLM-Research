    "solution": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we need to divide 369,963 by 6 and find the remainder.\n\n369,963 \u00f7 6 = 61,660 with a remainder of 3\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 3.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 3?: To find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we need to divide 369,963 by 6 and find the remainder.\n\n369,963 \u00f7 6 = 61,660 with a remainder of 3\n\nTherefore, the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6 is 3.",
