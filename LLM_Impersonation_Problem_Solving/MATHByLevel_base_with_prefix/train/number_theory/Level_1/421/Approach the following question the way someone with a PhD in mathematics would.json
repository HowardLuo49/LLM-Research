    "solution": "If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 2 and 3. Clearly, 369,963 is not divisible by 2. However, it is divisible by 3. Thus, the remainder after dividing by 6 is an odd, non-negative multiple of 3 that is less than 6. The only number such number is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when 369,963 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm.\n\nWe can express 369,963 as a multiple of 6 plus a remainder:\n\n369,963 = 6 * 61,660 + 3\n\nTherefore, when 369,963 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.",
