    "solution": "If we remember that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, then we know that $.\\overline{2}=\\frac29$. The reciprocal is $\\boxed{\\frac92}$.\n\nIf we didn't know that $\\frac19=.\\overline{1}$, we let $x=.\\overline{2}$. That means $10x=2.\\overline{2}$ and $9x=2.\\overline{2}-.\\overline{2}=2$. So $x=\\frac29$ and the reciprocal is $\\frac92$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the reciprocal of the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$, we first express the repeating decimal as an infinite series. \n\nLet $x = .\\overline{2}$. \n\nMultiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x = 2.\\overline{2}$. \n\nSubtracting the original equation from the new equation, we get $9x = 2$. \n\nTherefore, $x = \\frac{2}{9}$. \n\nTo find the reciprocal of $\\frac{2}{9}$, we simply invert the fraction, which gives us the result $\\frac{9}{2}$. \n\nThus, the reciprocal of the common fraction form of $.\\overline{2}$ is $\\frac{9}{2}$.",
