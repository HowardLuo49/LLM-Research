    "solution": "We see that $(7 - n) + (n + 3) = 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7,$ hence the remainder of the sum when divided by $7$ is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum of $7 - n$ and $n + 3$ is divided by 7, we first need to simplify the expression.\n\nFirst, simplify $7 - n + n + 3$:\n$7 - n + n + 3 = 10$\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 10 is divided by 7. We can do this by performing the division:\n\n$10 = 7(1) + 3$\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of $7 - n$ and $n + 3$ is divided by 7 is 3.",
