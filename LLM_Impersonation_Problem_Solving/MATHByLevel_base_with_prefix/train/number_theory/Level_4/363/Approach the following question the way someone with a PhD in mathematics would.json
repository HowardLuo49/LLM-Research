    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $x$ is divided by each of $4$, $5$, and $6$, remainders of $3$, $4$, and $5$ (respectively) are obtained. What is the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$?",
    "solution": "Note that $x+1$ is divisible by $4$, $5$, and $6$. Therefore, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $60$. Therefore, the smallest value for $x+1$ is $60$ and the smallest possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
    "gpt_response": "This problem can be formulated as a system of linear congruences. Let $x$ be the integer we are looking for. According to the given conditions, we have the following equations:\n\n$x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$  \n$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$  \n$x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$  \n\nWe can rewrite these congruences as follows:\n\n$x = 4a + 3$  \n$x = 5b + 4$  \n$x = 6c + 5$  \n\nWhere $a, b, c$ are integers. By setting these equations equal to each other, we get:\n\n$4a + 3 = 5b + 4 = 6c + 5$\n\nThis equation can be written as a single congruence:\n\n$4a + 3 \\equiv 5b + 4 \\equiv 6c + 5 \\pmod{\\text{lcm}(4,5,6)}$\n\nSolving this congruence gives us the smallest positive integer that satisfies all the conditions, which in this case is $\\text{lcm}(4,5,6) - 1 = 59$. Therefore, the smallest possible positive integer value of $x$ is $\\boxed{59}$.",
