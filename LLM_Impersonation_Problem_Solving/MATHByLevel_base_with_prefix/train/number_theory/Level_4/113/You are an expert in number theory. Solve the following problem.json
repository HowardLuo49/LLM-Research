    "solution": "Both $m$ and $n$ can be written in the form $11k+5$. For $m$, we have that $11k+5 \\ge 100$, so $k \\ge \\frac{95}{11}$, so since $k$ must be an integer, we have that $k = 9$, so $m = 11(9) + 5 = 104$. For $n$, we have that $11l+5 \\ge 1000$, so $l \\ge \\frac{995}{11}$, so since $l$ must be an integer, we have that $l = 91$, so $n = 11(91) + 5 = 1006$. Therefore, $n-m = 1006 - 104 = \\boxed{902}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), we can simply start with 5 and keep adding 11 until we reach a three-digit number. \nStarting from 5 and adding 11 repeatedly leads us to the number 16, which is a three-digit integer and is congruent to 5 (mod 11). Thus, $m = 16$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11), we can follow the same process starting from 5 and adding 11 until we reach a four-digit number. \nStarting from 5 and adding 11 repeatedly leads us to the number 16, which is a three-digit number and not a four-digit number. The next number obtained by adding 11 to 16 is 27, which is still a three-digit number. Continuing this process leads us to the number 38, which is a three-digit number as well. \nAdding 11 to 38 gives us 49, which is a four-digit number and is congruent to 5 (mod 11). Thus, $n = 49$.\n\nFinally, $n - m = 49 - 16 = 33$. \n\nTherefore, the difference between the smallest positive, four-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11) and the smallest positive, three-digit integer congruent to 5 (mod 11) is $\\boxed{33}$.",
