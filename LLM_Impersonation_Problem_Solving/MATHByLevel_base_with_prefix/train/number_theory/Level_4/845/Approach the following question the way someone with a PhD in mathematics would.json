    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive two-digit integers have an odd number of positive factors?",
    "solution": "Only square numbers have an odd number of factors. The $\\boxed{6}$ two-digit squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 and 81.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive two-digit integers with an odd number of positive factors, we first need to understand the relationship between factors and perfect squares. \n\nA positive integer has an odd number of factors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because for any positive integer n, each factor of n can be paired with another factor of n, except when the factor is the square root of n, in which case it is paired with itself. Therefore, the number of factors of n is odd if and only if n is a perfect square.\n\nIn a two-digit integer, the perfect squares are 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81. Therefore, there are 6 positive two-digit integers with an odd number of positive factors.",
