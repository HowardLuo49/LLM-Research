    "solution": "We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place. So we have $8\\_\\_\\_$. Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$. However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even. The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$. So the sum of the digits must be $18$. We maximize the integer with $88\\_\\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits. For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$. The largest integer is $\\boxed{8820}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9$, let us first consider the multiples of $9$ that satisfy this criteria. \n\nThe sum of the digits of a multiple of $9$ is also a multiple of $9$. Therefore, the sum of the digits of our desired number must be a multiple of $9$. Since we are looking for the largest number, we should use the largest even digits possible to achieve this.\n\nThe largest even digit is $8$. Since the sum of the digits must be a multiple of $9$, the only possible combination of even digits that could satisfy this criteria is $8, 8, 8, 8$ or $8888$. \n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9$ is $8888$.",
