    "solution": "We can tell that the integer is a multiple of $9$ if the sum of its digits is a multiple of $9$. For the largest integer with even digits that is less than $10,\\!000$, it must have the largest even digit, $8$, in the thousands place. So we have $8\\_\\_\\_$. Notice that the maximum integer with even digits is $8888$. However, the digits must add up to a multiple of $9$, and more specifically, an even multiple of $9$ since all of the digits are even. The closest even multiples of $9$ are $18$ and $36$, but the sum of the maximum integer $8888$ is only $32$. So the sum of the digits must be $18$. We maximize the integer with $88\\_\\_$, with a sum of $16$, which leaves a sum of $2$ for the remaining digits. For the digits to be even and to maximize the integer, the tens digit must be $2$ and the units digit must be $0$. The largest integer is $\\boxed{8820}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9$, we need to consider the possible combinations of even digits.\n\nSince the sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo $9$, in order for a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of $9$.\n\nThe even digits less than $10$ are $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$. Since we are looking for the largest possible number, we should choose the largest even digits possible.\n\nIf we choose $8$ as the thousands digit, then to have the sum of the digits be a multiple of $9$, the sum of the other three digits must be $9$.\n\nOne possibility is $8, 0, 0, 1$, which does not work since $1$ is an odd digit. Another possibility is $8, 2, 2, 3$, which also does not work since $3$ is an odd digit.\n\nThe next possible combination is $6, 8, 8, 8$, which does work since the sum of the digits is $6 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 30$ which is a multiple of $9$.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer with only even digits that is less than $10,000$ and is a multiple of $9$ is $\\boxed{6888}$.",
