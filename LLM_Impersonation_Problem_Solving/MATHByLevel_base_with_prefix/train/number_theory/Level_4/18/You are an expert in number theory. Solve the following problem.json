The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is $(x+5)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 50, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 5) \\cdot x(x + 5)}{50} = \\frac{x(x + 5)^2}{50}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nWe are told that the greatest common divisor is $x + 5$, so $x + 5$ divides 50.  The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.  Since $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 5.  When $x = 5$, the other number is $5 \\cdot 10^2/50 = 10$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 10 and 50 is 10, and $x + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10$.  The least common multiple is 50, and $x(x + 5) = 5 \\cdot (5 + 5) = 50$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two positive integers be $a$ and $50$. Let us express $a$ as a multiple of $(x+5)$. Since $(x+5)$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $50$, we can express $a$ as $a = (x+5)k$. \n\nGiven that their least common multiple is $x(x+5)$, we have the equation:\n\n$$\\text{lcm}(a,50) = \\frac{a \\cdot 50}{\\text{gcd}(a,50)} = x(x+5)$$\n\nSubstitute $a=(x+5)k$ into the above equation:\n\n$$\\frac{(x+5)k \\cdot 50}{(x+5)} = x(x+5)$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$50k = x$$\n\nSince $x$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $x$ is 50. Substitute this back into $50k = x$:\n\n$$50k = 50$$\n$$k = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the other integer $a$ is $x+5 = 50+5 = 55$. So, the smallest possible value of the other integer is $\\boxed{55}$.",
