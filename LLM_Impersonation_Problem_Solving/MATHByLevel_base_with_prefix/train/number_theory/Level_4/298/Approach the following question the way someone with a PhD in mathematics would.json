    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 2006!$, we can consider the units digit of each factorial term individually.\n\nThe units digit of $n!$ is determined by the product of all the integers from 1 to $n$. Since we are only interested in the units digit, we can simplify the calculation by only considering the units digit of each integer. We can use the following pattern:\n\n- $1!$ has units digit 1\n- $2!$ has units digit 2\n- $3!$ has units digit 6\n- $4!$ has units digit 4\n- $5!$ has units digit 0\n- $6!$ has units digit 0\n- $7!$ has units digit 0\n- $8!$ has units digit 0\n- $9!$ has units digit 0\n- $10!$ has units digit 0\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that starting from $5!$, the units digit of factorial terms become 0. Therefore, when we sum up all factorial terms from $6!$ to $2006!$ inclusive, the units digit of each term would be 0.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 2006!$ is the same as the units digit of $1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 0 = 13$. The units digit of 13 is 3. So, the units digit of the sum is 3.",
