    "solution": "Since the units digits of $n!$ is always 0 when $n$ is an integer greater than 4, we just sum the first few factorials to get our answer: $1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of the sum of factorials, we need to consider the units digit of each factorial separately and then sum them up.\n\nFor any integer greater than or equal to 5, the factorial will end in 0 because it has a factor of 5 and 2 in it. For integers less than 5:\n\n1! = 1\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n\nSumming up the units digits of 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! gives us:\n\n1 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 13\n\nSo, the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \\cdots + 2006!$ will be the same as the units digit of the sum $13 + 0 + 0 + \\cdots + 0$ (since all the factorials from 5! to 2006! end in 0).\n\nThe sum $13 + 0 + 0 + \\cdots + 0$ will also end in 3.
