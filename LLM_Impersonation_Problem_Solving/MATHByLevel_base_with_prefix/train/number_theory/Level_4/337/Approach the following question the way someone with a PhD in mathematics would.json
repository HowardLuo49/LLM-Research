    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can set up a system of equations. Let's denote the number of quarters as q, the number of dimes as d, and the number of pennies as p. Given the information in the question, we have the following two equations:\n\n1. 25q + 1p = amount - 3\n2. 10d + 1p = amount - 8\n\nSince the total amount of change George is trying to get is less than one dollar, we know the maximum number of quarters he can receive is 3 (as 4 quarters would exceed a dollar). The maximum number of dimes he can receive is 9 (as 10 dimes would exceed a dollar). \n\nTo find the possible amounts of change George is trying to get, let's consider all possible values of q and d that satisfy the above conditions. We can then calculate the corresponding sums of change in cents. \n\nFor q = 3, we have:\n25(3) + 1p = amount - 3\n75 + p = amount - 3\np = amount - 78\n\nFor d = 9, we have:\n10(9) + 1p = amount - 8\n90 + p = amount - 8\np = amount - 98\n\nNow, we can find the possible amounts of change George is trying to get by considering all combinations of p that satisfy the conditions:\n\nFor q = 0, 1, 2:\namount = 78, 79, 80\n\nFor d = 0, 1, ..., 9:\namount = 98, 99, ..., 107\n\nTherefore, the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get are 78, 79, 80, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107. The sum of these amounts in cents is 1125 cents.",
