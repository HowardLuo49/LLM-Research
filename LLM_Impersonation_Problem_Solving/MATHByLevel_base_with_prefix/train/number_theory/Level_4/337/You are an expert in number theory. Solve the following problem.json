    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. George is about to get a certain amount of change less than one dollar from the cash register. If he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 3 pennies to meet the amount. If he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, he would need to receive 8 pennies to meet the amount. What is the sum, in cents, of the possible amounts of change that he is trying to get?",
    "solution": "An amount in quarters is 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents. If George still needs 3 pennies, then the possible amounts of change he needs are 3, 28, 53, or 78 cents. With dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 is 8. So the only possible amounts George could be getting are 28 cents or 78 cents, which add up to $\\boxed{106}$ cents.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the amount in cents that George is trying to get as x. \n\nFrom the first scenario where he gets the most quarters possible and the rest in pennies, we can write the equation:\n25q + 3 = x \n\nFrom the second scenario where he gets the most dimes possible and the rest in pennies, we can write the equation:\n10d + 8 = x \n\nSince x is less than one dollar, we know that x < 100. \n\nLet's analyze these equations:\n- In the first scenario, if George received one more quarter, he would exceed the amount x by 22 cents since 25q + 25 = x + 22. This means that x = 25q + 3 is exactly 22 cents less than the next multiple of 25.\n- In the second scenario, if George received one more dime, he would exceed the amount x by 2 cents since 10d + 10 = x + 2. This means that x = 10d + 8 is exactly 2 cents less than the next multiple of 10.\n\nFrom the first scenario, x is a number that is 22 less than a multiple of 25. We list out possible values of x: 22, 47, 72, 97. \n\nFrom the second scenario, x is a number that is 2 less than a multiple of 10. We list out possible values of x: 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92. \n\nThe common values of x are 22, 72. Thus, the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get are 22 cents and 72 cents. The sum of these possible amounts is 22 + 72 = 94 cents. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible amounts of change that George is trying to get is 94 cents.",
