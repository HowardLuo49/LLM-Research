    "solution": "$x$ must be a divisor of 2007. To count the number of divisors, we note that a divisor can have zero factors of 3, one factor, or two factors, and (independently) it can have zero factors of 223 or one factor. The total number of divisors is then $3\\cdot2=6$ (3 choices for the factors of 3 and 2 choices for the factors of 223). Since each divisor is unique, each creates a unique ordered pair. So there are $\\boxed{6}$ ordered pairs.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $xy=2007$, we first need to consider the prime factorization of 2007, which is $3^{2}\\times223$.\n\nSince $xy=2007$, we can express $x$ as $3^{a}\\times223^{b}$ and $y$ as $3^{c}\\times223^{d}$, where $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative integers.\n\nThen the equation becomes $3^{a+c}\\times223^{b+d}=3^{2}\\times223$\n\nThis means that $a+c=2$ and $b+d=1$.
