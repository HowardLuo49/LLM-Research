    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. How many perfect squares less than 1000 have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4?",
    "solution": "Checking the squares from $1^2$ to $10^2$, we see that no squares end in 2 or 3, while a square ends in 4 if its square root ends in 2 or 8.  Since $31^2 < 1000 < 32^2$, we see that the squares less than 1000 ending in 4 are $2,8,12,18,22,28$.  Thus the desired answer is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find perfect squares with a ones digit of 2, 3, or 4, we consider the possible units digits of perfect squares:\n\n- If the units digit is 2, the number must end in 8 or 2.\n- If the units digit is 3, the number must end in 7 or 3.\n- If the units digit is 4, the number must end in 6 or 4.\n\nSince we only need to consider numbers less than 1000, we only need to consider the numbers 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, and 4.\n\nSquares ending in 8 and 2: The only number ending in 8 is 8 itself, and the only number ending in 2 is 2 itself. So, there are 2 squares that end in 2 or 8: 4 and 64.\n\nSquares ending in 7 and 3: The numbers ending in 7 or 3 are 3 and 7. So, there are 2 squares that end in 3 or 7: 9 and 49.\n\nSquares ending in 6 and 4: The numbers ending in 6 or 4 are 4 and 6. So, there are 2 squares that end in 4 or 6: 16 and 36.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 perfect squares less than 1000 that have a ones digit of 2, 3 or 4.",
