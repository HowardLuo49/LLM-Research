    "solution": "First, we simplify $1234 \\pmod{7}$ to $1234 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, we have $$17n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$$This means that $17n$ can be written in the form $7a+2$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $17n=7a+2$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{7a+2}{17}=n$ is an integer. By trying values for $a$, we find that the smallest integer $a$ which satisfies the equation is $7$. Therefore, the least value for $n$ is $\\frac{51}{17}=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can simplify the given congruence as:\n\n$17n \\equiv 1234 \\pmod{7} \\\\ 3n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$\n\nNow we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence. We can:\n\n$3 \\cdot 1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ \\\\\n$3 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$ \\\\\n$3 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$ \\\\\n$3 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the congruence is $n = 4$.",
