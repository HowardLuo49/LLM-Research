    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of base conversion and use some algebraic manipulations. \n\nLet's denote the unknown positive integer in decimal as N. \nWhen N is expressed in base 7 as $AB_7$, it means that N = 7A + B. \nSimilarly, when N is expressed in base 5 as $BA_5$, it means that N = 5B + A. \n\nNow, we can set the two expressions for N equal to each other: \n7A + B = 5B + A\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n6A = 4B\n3A = 2B\n\nSince we are looking for positive integers A and B, the smallest solution to this equation is A = 2 and B = 3. \n\nTherefore, the positive integer N in decimal is: \nN = 7A + B = 7(2) + 3 = 17\n\nHence, the positive integer in decimal is 17.",
