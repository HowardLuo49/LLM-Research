    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers, we need to consider the prime factorization of these integers.\n\nLet's denote the three consecutive positive integers as n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nThe product of these three consecutive integers is (n)(n+1)(n+2) = n(n^2 + 2n + 1).\n\nExpanding this expression gives us n^3 + 2n^2 + n.\n\nNow, let's consider the prime factorization of each of these terms:\n\nn = p_1^a_1 * p_2^a_2 * ... * p_k^a_k\nn^2 = p_1^(2a_1) * p_2^(2a_2) * ... * p_k^(2a_k)\nn^3 = p_1^(3a_1) * p_2^(3a_2) * ... * p_k^(3a_k)\n\nTherefore, the greatest divisor of n(n^2 + 2n + 1) is the product of the highest powers of each prime factor that appears in the prime factorization of n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nFor example, if we consider the consecutive integers 3, 4, and 5, the prime factorization of their product is 3*4*5 = 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. Therefore, the greatest divisor that must appear in the product is 5.\n\nMore generally, the greatest divisor that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is the largest prime factor common to all three integers.\n\nThus, the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 3, since it is the largest prime common to any three consecutive positive integers.",
