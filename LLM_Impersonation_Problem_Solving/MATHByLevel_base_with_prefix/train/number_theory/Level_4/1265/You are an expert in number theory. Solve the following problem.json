    "solution": "We know that at least one of our three consecutive positive integers must be a multiple of $2$ since every other integer in a list of consecutive integers is divisible by $2$. Similarly, one of our three consecutive integers must also be divisible by $3$. Thus, the product of our three integers must be divisible by $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. By choosing the example where our three consecutive integers are $1$, $2$, and $3$ and their product is $6$, we see that $\\boxed{6}$ is indeed the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three consecutive positive integers be n, n+1, and n+2.\n\nThe product of these three consecutive integers is (n) * (n+1) * (n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2).\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of n(n+1)(n+2).\n\nSince n, n+1, and n+2 are consecutive positive integers, then at least one of them must be divisible by 2. Also, at least one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product n(n+1)(n+2) is divisible by 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the greatest whole number that must be a divisor of the product of any three consecutive positive integers is 6.",
