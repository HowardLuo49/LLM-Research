    "solution": "We try finding the remainders when increasing powers of 5 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n5^1\\div 7 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of } 5.\\\\\n5^2\\div 7 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of } 4.\\\\\n5^3\\div 7&\\text{ leaves a remainder of } 6.\\\\\n5^4\\div 7&\\text{ leaves a remainder of } 2.\\\\\n5^5\\div 7&\\text{ leaves a remainder of }3.\\\\\n5^6\\div 7 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of }1.\\\\\n5^7\\div 7 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of } 5.\\\\\n5^8\\div 7 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of }4.\n\\end{align*} $$\\vdots$$ The remainders repeat after every 6 powers of 5. So we look for the remainder when 207 is divided by 6, which leaves a remainder of 3. We could use long division, but notice that 207 is a multiple of 3 (digits sum to 9, which is a multiple of 3) but is not a multiple of 2. That means 207 is not divisible by 6 and must be exactly 3 more than a multiple of 6. So the remainder for $5^{207}$ when divided by 7 is the same as the remainder when $5^3$ is divided by 7, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{207}$ is divided by 7, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that for any prime number $p$ and any integer $a$, where $a$ is not divisible by $p$, we have\n\n$$a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}.$$\n\nIn this case, $p = 7$, so $p-1 = 6$. Therefore, $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, let's express $5^{207}$ as $(5^6)^{34}\\cdot5^3$. Since $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, it follows that \n\n$$5^{207} \\equiv (1)^{34}\\cdot5^3 \\equiv 5^3 \\pmod{7}.$$\n\nCalculating $5^3$, we get $125 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $5^{207}$ is divided by 7 is $\\boxed{6}$.",
