    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers?",
    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be an integer. Then the product of any $4$ consecutive integers can be expressed as $(n)(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$. \n\nFrom the pigeonhole principle, we know that among any $4$ consecutive integers, at least one of them must be even. Therefore, the product of any $4$ consecutive integers will always be divisible by $2$.\n\nSimilarly, we observe that among any $4$ consecutive integers, at least one of them must be divisible by $3$. Hence, the product of any $4$ consecutive integers will also be divisible by $3$.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.",
