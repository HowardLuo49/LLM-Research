    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $gcd(3n+4,n)=d$, then $d$ divides both $3n+4$ and $n$. This implies that $d$ must also divide $4$, as $4$ is the remainder when $3n+4$ is divided by $n$. Therefore, the possible values of $d$ are the divisors of $4$, which are $1, 2,$ and $4$.\n\nIf $d=1$, then $3n+4$ and $n$ are relatively prime. This implies that $3n+4$ and $n$ have no common factors other than $1$, which means that both must be odd. However, $3n+4$ is always even, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, $d$ cannot be $1$.\n\nIf $d=2$, then $n$ must be even in order for $3n+4$ to be divisible by $2$. Let $n=2k$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $gcd(3n+4,n) = gcd(3(2k)+4,2k) = gcd(6k+4,2k) = gcd(4,2k) = 2$. So the only possible $d$ in this case is $d=2$.\n\nIf $d=4$, then $3n+4$ and $n$ are both divisible by $4$. However, this implies that $n$ is also divisible by $4$, which means that $3n+4$ is divisible by $4$. Therefore, $d$ can indeed be $4$.\n\nIn conclusion, the only possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are $2$ and $4$. The sum of these values is $\\boxed{6}$.",
