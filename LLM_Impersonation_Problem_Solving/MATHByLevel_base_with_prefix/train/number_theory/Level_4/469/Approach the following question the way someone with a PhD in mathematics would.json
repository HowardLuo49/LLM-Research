    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $3n+4$ and $n$ as $n$ ranges over the positive integers, we need to first consider the properties of GCD.\n\nLet $d$ be the GCD of $3n+4$ and $n$. This means that $d$ divides both $3n+4$ and $n$.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that $d$ must also divide the difference between $3n+4$ and $n$, which is $2n+4$. So, $d$ divides $2n+4$ as well.\n\nNext, we can express $2n+4$ in terms of $n$ as $2n+4 = 2(n+2)$. Therefore, $d$ divides $2(n+2)$.\n\nSince $d$ divides both $3n+4$ and $2(n+2)$, it also divides their linear combination $3(2(n+2)) - 2(3n+4) = 6n+12-6n-8 = 4$.\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of $d$ is equal to the sum of all divisors of $4$.\n\nThe divisors of $4$ are $1, 2, 4$, so the sum of all possible values of $d$ is $1 + 2 + 4 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ as $n$ ranges over the positive integers is $7$.",
