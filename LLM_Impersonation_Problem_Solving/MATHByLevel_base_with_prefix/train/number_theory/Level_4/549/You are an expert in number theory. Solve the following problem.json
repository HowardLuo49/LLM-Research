    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45, we must have that the entire three-digit integer $\\_\\_$ at the beginning is divisible by 9 and that the digits $4$ and $5$ combined form a number divisible by 5.\n\nFirst, we find all the three-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_$ that are divisible by 9. The sum of the digits in any three-digit integer must be divisible by 9 for the entire number to be divisible by 9. Since we are looking for numbers in the form $\\_\\_45$, the sum of the digits would be $x+x+4+5 = 2x+9$, where $x$ is the digit of $\\_\\_$. For this sum to be divisible by 9, $x$ must be 0, 3, 6, or 9.\n\nNext, we need the last two digits, $45$, to be divisible by 5. Since 45 is already divisible by 5, we must find all the three-digit numbers from the previous step that, when ending in 5, will result in a number that is divisible by 5.\n\nLooking at the possibilities for the digit $x$, we can see that if $x = 0$ or $x = 9$, the number is already divisible by 5. So we have found two valid four-digit integers: $0945$ and $9945$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{2}$ positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45.",
