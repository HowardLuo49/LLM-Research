    "solution": "Let the four-digit integer be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ denote digits.  We may subtract 45 without changing whether the integer is divisible by 45, so let's consider $ab00$ instead of $ab45$.  A number is divisible by $45$ if and only if it is divisible by both 9 and 5.  Since the prime factorization of $ab00$ is the prime factorization of $ab$ times $2^2\\cdot5^2$, $ab00$ is divisible by 45 if and only if $ab$ is divisible by $9$.  The two-digit integers divisible by 9 are $9\\cdot 2$, $9\\cdot 3$, $\\ldots$, and $9\\cdot 11$.  There are $11-2+1=\\boxed{10}$ of them.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45, we first need to understand the properties of numbers that are divisible by 45. \n\nA number is divisible by 45 if it is divisible by both 5 and 9. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. \n\nGiven that the last two digits are fixed as 45, we need to find the first two digits that would make the number divisible by 45. Let the number be $ab45$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits.\n\nSince the number is divisible by 5, $b$ must be either 0 or 5. \n\nFor the number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Thus, $a + b + 4 + 5 = a + b + 9$ must be divisible by 9. This implies that $a + b$ must be a multiple of 9. As $b$ is restricted to be 0 or 5, the only possibilities for $a$ are 4 and 9.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $a$ and $b$ are (4,5), (4,0), (9,5), and (9,0), resulting in the positive four-digit integers 4545, 4505, 945, and 9005.\n\nIn conclusion, there are four positive four-digit integers of the form $\\_\\_45$ that are divisible by 45: 4545, 4505, 945, and 9005.",
