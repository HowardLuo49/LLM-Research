    "solution": "When summing these three numbers, we notice that $5 + 4 + 1$ leaves a residue of $1$ when divided by $9$, so it follows that the sum has a rightmost digit of $1$ and that carry-over must occur. After carrying over to the next digit, we must find the sum of $1 + 7 + 1 + 6 = 16_9$, which leaves a residue of $6$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we write down $6$ as the next digit and carry-over another $1$. Evaluating the next digit, we must find the sum of $1+1+7 = 10_9$, which leaves a residue of $0$ when divided by $9$. Thus, we must carry-over one more time, yielding that: $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{1} & \\stackrel{1}{7} & \\stackrel{}{5}_{9} \\\\ & & & 7 & 1 & 4_{9} \\\\ &+ & & & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\cline{2-6} && 1 & 0 & 6 & 1_{9} \\\\ \\end{array} $$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1061_{9}}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can notice that $175_9 + 714_9 = 1000_9$, so $1000_9 + 61_9 = 1061_9$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add the numbers $175_9$, $714_9$, and $61_9$, we can first line them up by place value:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r}\n\\phantom{0}1\\phantom{7}\\phantom{6}5_{9} \\\\\n+\\phantom{0}7\\phantom{1}4_{9} \\\\\n+\\phantom{0}\\phantom{6}6\\phantom{1}_{9} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nStarting from the rightmost column, we add the digits in each column. In the rightmost column, we have $5 + 4 + 1 = 10_{10} = 11_{9}$. We write down the 1 in the current column and carry over the 1 to the next column. The next column to the left gives us $7 + 1 + 1 = 19_{10} = 21_{9}$. We write down the 1 in the current column and carry over the 2 to the next column. For the leftmost column, we have $1 + 7 + 2 = 10_{10} = 11_{9}$. Thus, the sum of $175_9$, $714_9$, and $61_9$ is $1111_9$.",
