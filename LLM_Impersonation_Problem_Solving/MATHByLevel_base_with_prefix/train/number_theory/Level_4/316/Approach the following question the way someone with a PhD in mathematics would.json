    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $\\textit{palindrome}$ is a number which reads the same forward as backward. For example, 343 and 1221 are palindromes. What is the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome?",
    "solution": "We are asked to find the positive difference between 40305 and the least palindrome greater than 40305.  The only five-digit palindrome beginning with 403 is 40304, which is less than 40305.  The next smallest possibility for the first three digits is 404, which gives the palindrome 40404.  The difference between 40404 and 40305 is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N$ be the unknown number we must add to 40,305 to create a palindrome. Since the resulting number must be a palindrome, the last digit of $N$ must be the same as the first digit of 40,305 (which is 5). Additionally, the second-to-last digit of $N$ must be the same as the second digit of 40,305 (which is 0). Thus, we can express $N$ in the form $50AB5$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest possible value of $AB$. To create a palindrome, the third digit of $N$ (A) must be the same as the third digit of 40,305 (which is 0). Therefore, the least natural number that can be added to 40,305 to create a palindrome is $50 \\cdot 10 + 5 = \\boxed{505}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 99?: Let $N$ be the unknown number we must add to 40,305 to create a palindrome.
