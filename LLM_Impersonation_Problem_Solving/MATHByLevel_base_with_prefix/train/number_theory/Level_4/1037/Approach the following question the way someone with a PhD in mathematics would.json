    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. In a certain base $b$, the square of $22_b$ is $514_b$.  What is $b$?",
    "solution": "We have that $22_b = 2b + 2$ and $514_b = 5b^2 + b + 4$.  Hence, $(2b + 2)^2 = 5b^2 + b + 4$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 7b = 0$.  This equation factors as $b(b - 7) = 0$, so $b = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the value of $22_b$ in base 10. Then $22_b = 2b + 2 = 2b + 2$. \n\nThe square of $22_b$ can be expressed as $(2b + 2)^2$. Expanding this expression, we get $4b^2 + 8b + 4$. This is equal to $514_b$ which can be written in base 10 as $5b^2 + b + 4$. \n\nSetting the two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation $4b^2 + 8b + 4 = 5b^2 + b + 4$. \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $b^2 - 7b = 0$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $b$ are $b = 0$ or $b = 7$. However, since $b$ is the base of our number system, it must be greater than 1. \n\nHence, the only possible value for $b$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",

    "gpt_response_correct_incorrect": "No. The final solution obtained in the response is 7, not 7. The answer is incorrect as it states that the possible value for b is 7 when actually b can be either 0 or 7, but since it has to be greater than 1, the only valid solution is 7.",
