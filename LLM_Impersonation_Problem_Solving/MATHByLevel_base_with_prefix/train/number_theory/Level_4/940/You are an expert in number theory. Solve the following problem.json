    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "The sum of the numbers can be rewritten as the sum of an arithmetic series with first term $1$, last term $259$, and common difference $6$. \n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S$ is the sum, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. \n\nIn this case, the first term is $1$, the last term is $259$, and the common difference is $6$.
