    "solution": "First of all, we see that every term has a remainder of $1$ when divided by $6.$ Now, we just need to find how many terms there are. The nth term can be given by the expression $6n - 5.$ Therefore, we set $259 = 6n - 5$ to find $n = 44,$ thus there are $44$ terms in our sum. Thus, the remainder of the sum is the same as the remainder of $44$ when divided by $6,$ which is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the sum $1 + 7 + 13 + 19 + \\cdots + 253 + 259$ is divided by $6$, we first observe that each term in the sum is 6 more than the previous term. \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the sum as a arithmetic series: $1 + (1+6) + (1+2\\cdot6) + \\cdots + (1+43\\cdot6)$.\n\nThe number of terms in this series is given by $n = \\frac{259-1}{6} + 1 = 44$.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get $S = \\frac{44}{2}(1 + 259) = 22 \\cdot 260 = 5720$.\n\nNow, to find the remainder when 5720 is divided by 6, we divide 5720 by 6: $5720 = 6 \\cdot 953 + 2$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$.",
