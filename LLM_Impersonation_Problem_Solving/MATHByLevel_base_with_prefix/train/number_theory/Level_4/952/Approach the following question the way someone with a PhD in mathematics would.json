    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many prime numbers between 30 and 65 have a prime remainder when divided by 10?",
    "solution": "If a prime number between 30 and 65 has a prime remainder when divided by 10, it must end in 3 or 7, since any number greater than 10 ending in 2 or 5 is composite.  Systemically checking all possibilities, we see that the only such primes are 37, 43, 47, and 53, which gives us a total of $\\boxed{4}$ such numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10, we first need to identify the prime numbers within this range. The prime numbers between 30 and 65 are 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, and 61.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these prime numbers have a prime remainder when divided by 10. To do this, we find the remainder of each prime number when divided by 10 and check if this remainder is a prime number. \n\nWhen we divide the prime numbers by 10, we get the following remainders:\n- 31 divided by 10 is 3 (prime)\n- 37 divided by 10 is 7 (prime)\n- 41 divided by 10 is 1 (not prime)\n- 43 divided by 10 is 3 (prime)\n- 47 divided by 10 is 7 (prime)\n- 53 divided by 10 is 3 (prime)\n- 59 divided by 10 is 9 (not prime)\n- 61 divided by 10 is 1 (not prime)\n\nTherefore, the prime numbers between 30 and 65 that have a prime remainder when divided by 10 are 31, 37, 43, and 47. There are 4 prime numbers within this range that meet the criteria.",
