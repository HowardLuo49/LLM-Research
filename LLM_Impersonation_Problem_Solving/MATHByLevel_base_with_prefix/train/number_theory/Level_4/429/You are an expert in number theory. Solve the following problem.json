    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of factors of $n$, we first need to express $n$ in its prime factorization. We know that $2^4 = 2^4$, $3^5 = 3^5$, $4^6 = (2^2)^6 = 2^{12}$, and $6^7 = 2^7 3^7$.
