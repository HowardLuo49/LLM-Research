    "solution": "Rewriting and reducing the fraction, we get $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^3\\cdot5^8} = \\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2^6$, we obtain\n\\[\\frac{3}{2\\cdot5^7}\\cdot\\frac{2^6}{2^6} = \\frac{3\\cdot2^6}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{192}{10^7} = .0000192.\\]Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
    "gpt_response": "To express $\\frac{60}{2^3\\cdot5^8}$ as a decimal, we need to simplify the fraction first. \n\nWe have $2^3 = 8$ and $5^8 = 390625$. Thus, we can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{60}{8\\cdot390625} = \\frac{60}{3125000}$. \n\nTo convert this fraction to a decimal, we divide 60 by 3125000. The result is approximately 0.0000192.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 non-zero digits to the right of the decimal point.",
