    "solution": "We can use the distributive property of multiplication to multiply a three-digit palindrome $aba$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) with 101: $$ 101 \\cdot aba = (100 + 1) \\cdot aba = aba00 + aba = ab(2a)ba. $$Here, the digits of the product are $a$, $b$, $2a$, $b$, and $a$, unless carrying occurs.  In fact, this product is a palindrome unless carrying occurs, and that could only happen when $2a \\ge 10$.  Since we want the smallest such palindrome in which carrying occurs, we want the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $2a \\ge 10$ and the smallest possible value of $b$.  This gives us $\\boxed{505}$ as our answer and we see that $101 \\cdot 505 = 51005$ is not a palindrome.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest three-digit palindrome, we can start by considering the palindromes in increasing order: 101, 111, 121, 131, ... \n\nWe can represent a three-digit palindrome as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, c are digits. For the product with 101 to not be a five-digit palindrome, the product should not exceed 9999.
