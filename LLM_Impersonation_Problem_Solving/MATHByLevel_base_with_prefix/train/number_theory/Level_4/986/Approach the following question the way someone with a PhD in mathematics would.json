    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are integers such that   $$3b = 8 - 2a.$$How many of the first six positive integers must be divisors of $2b + 12$?",
    "solution": "Note that it is possible that $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, since $3\\cdot 2 = 8 - 2 \\cdot 1$. Then $2b + 12 = 16$. Since $3,$ $5,$ and $6,$ are not factors of $16$, it is not true that these numbers must be divisors of $2b + 12.$\n\nIt only remains to check whether $1$, $2$, and $4$ must be divisors of $2b + 12$. The distributive property gives us   $$8 - 2a = 2 \\cdot 4 - 2a = 2(4 -a),$$so $2$ is a factor of $3b$. Note that   $$b = 3b - 2b,$$so since $2$ is a factor of $3b$ and $2$ is a factor of $2b,$ $2$ must be a factor of $b.$ So we can say $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$. Substituting gives us    \\begin{align*}\n2b + 12 &= 2(2n) + 12\\\\\n&= 4n + 4 \\cdot 3\\\\\n&= 4(n + 3),\n\\end{align*}so $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$. Since $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $4$ and $4$ is a factor of $2b + 12$, it must be true that $1,$ $2,$ and $4$ are factors of $2b + 12$. So our final answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's start by solving for $b$ in terms of $a$ using the given equation:\n\n$$3b = 8 - 2a$$\n$$b = \\frac{8 - 2a}{3} = \\frac{4 - a}{3}$$\n\nNow, let's express $2b + 12$ in terms of $a$:\n\n$$2b + 12 = 2\\left(\\frac{4 - a}{3}\\right) + 12 = \\frac{8 - 2a}{3} + 12 = \\frac{8 - 2a + 36}{3} = \\frac{44 - 2a}{3} = \\frac{2(22 - a)}{3}$$\n\nNow, in order for $2b + 12$ to be divisible by a positive integer, $22-a$ must be divisible by $3$ since the numerator is always divisible by $2$. So, we need to find out how many of the first six positive integers are divisors of $22$.\n\nThe first six positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Among these, only 1, 2, and 11 are divisors of 22.
