    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8, we can use the modular exponentiation technique. \n\nFirst, note that 8 is equivalent to 0 modulo 8. Therefore, we need to find the remainder of $5^{137}$ modulo 8. \n\nWe can rewrite $5^{137}$ as $(2 + 3)^{137}$ using the fact that $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{8}$.\n\nExpanding this using the binomial theorem, we get:\n\n$5^{137} \\equiv (2^{137} + \\binom{137}{1}2^{136}3 + \\binom{137}{2}2^{135}3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{137}) \\mod 8$\n\nNotice that all even powers of 2 are congruent to 0 modulo 8, and that $3^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 8$. Since all higher powers of 3 in this expansion will result in multiples of 3, they will also be equivalent to 0 modulo 8. \n\nThus, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is simply $2^{137} \\mod 8$.\n\nNow we need to find the remainder when $2^{137}$ is divided by 8. The powers of 2 modulo 8 follow the repeating pattern: {2, 4, 0, 0}. \n\nTherefore, $2^{137} \\equiv 2^1 \\equiv 2 \\mod 8$.\n\nHence, the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8 is 2.",
