    "solution": "The given congruence has a solution if and only if $a$ is invertible modulo $12$ since the congruence implies that $a,x$ are inverses of each other modulo $12$. In other words, $\\gcd(12,a)=1$. The only such positive $a$ less than $12$ are $1,5,7,11$. So the number of possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive integers $a$ less than $12$ such that the congruence $ax\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$ has a solution in $x$, we must find all numbers $a$ that are coprime to $12$. This is because $ax\\equiv 1\\pmod{12}$ has a solution in $x$ if and only if $\\gcd(a, 12) = 1$.\n\nThe positive integers less than $12$ that are coprime to $12$ are 1, 5, 7, and 11. Thus, there are $\\boxed{4}$ such integers $a$.",
