    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Jenny has 8 stamp books that each contain 42 pages.  Each page in her books contains 6 stamps.  Jenny decides to reorganize her stamp books such that each page contains 10 stamps.  This will give her more space to collect stamps without having to buy new books.  Under her new system, Jenny fills up 4 complete books, still with 42 pages per book.  Her fifth book now contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page and 1 last page with the remaining stamps.  How many stamps are on that last page?",
    "solution": "Since Jenny's new system of arranging stamps includes 10 on each page, the number of the last page will be the units digit of her total number of stamps (in base 10).  That units digit is the same as the units digit of $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6 = 96$, which is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's calculate the total number of stamps in Jenny's stamp books before she reorganizes them.\nEach book contains 42 pages, and each page contains 6 stamps.\nSo, the total number of stamps in each book is 42 pages * 6 stamps/page = 252 stamps.\nSince Jenny has 8 stamp books, the total number of stamps before reorganizing is 8 books * 252 stamps/book = 2016 stamps.\n\nAfter reorganizing her stamp books, Jenny fills up 4 complete books with 10 stamps per page, which is a total of 42 pages * 10 stamps/page = 420 stamps per book. So the total number of stamps in 4 complete books is 4 books * 420 stamps/book = 1680 stamps.\n\nHer fifth book contains 33 pages filled with 10 stamps per page, which is 33 pages * 10 stamps/page = 330 stamps. This means there are 1680 + 330 = 2010 stamps filled in.\n\nThe remaining stamps must be on the last page of her fifth book. Since the total number of stamps is 2016, and 2010 stamps are already distributed, the number of stamps on the last page is 2016 total stamps - 2010 distributed stamps = 6 stamps.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 stamps on the last page of Jenny's fifth book.",
