    "solution": "Noticing that $190\\equiv0\\pmod{19}$ and $-200+190=-10$, we can say that  \\[-200\\equiv n\\pmod{19}\\]if and only if  \\[-10\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]This is not in the range $0\\leq n<19$, but adding 19 again gives \\[9\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]The answer is $n=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ that satisfies the congruence $-200 \\equiv n \\pmod{19}$, we first note that this equation is equivalent to $-200 \\equiv n \\mod 19$. This means that $n$ is the remainder when $-200$ is divided by $19$.\n\nWe can start by dividing $-200$ by $19$ to find the remainder. $$-200 = -19 \\times 10 + 10$$\nTherefore, the remainder when $-200$ is divided by $19$ is $10$. \n\nSince we are looking for an integer $n$ that satisfies $0 \\leq n < 19$, we can conclude that $n = 10$.
