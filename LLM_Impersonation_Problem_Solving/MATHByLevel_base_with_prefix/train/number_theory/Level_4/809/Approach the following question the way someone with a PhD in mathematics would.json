    "solution": "We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime. Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$. Since $11 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \\cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \\cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \\cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{91} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $11x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$. This means we are looking for a number $x$ such that $11x = 1 + 1000k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $11x - 1000k = 1$, which is a linear Diophantine equation. We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the solutions to this equation.\n\nApplying the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the greatest common divisor of $11$ and $1000$ is $1$, which means the modular inverse of $11$ modulo $1000$ exists.\n\nSolving the linear Diophantine equation $11x - 1000k = 1$, we find one particular solution where $x = -91$ and $k = -1$.
