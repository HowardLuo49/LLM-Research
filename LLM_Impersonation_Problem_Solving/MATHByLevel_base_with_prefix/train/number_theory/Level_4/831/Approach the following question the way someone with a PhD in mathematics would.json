    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $S$ modulo 2010, we first look for patterns in the sum. \n\nIf we group the terms in pairs, we can see that $(1-2) + (3-4) + \\cdots + (2009-2010) = -1 -1 - \\cdots -1$, where there are 1005 pairs of -1. \n\nTherefore, the sum $S = -1005$. \n\nTaking the residue of $-1005$ modulo 2010, we get $2010 - 1005 \\equiv 1005 \\pmod{2010}$.\n\nSo, the residue of $S$ modulo 2010 is 1005.",
