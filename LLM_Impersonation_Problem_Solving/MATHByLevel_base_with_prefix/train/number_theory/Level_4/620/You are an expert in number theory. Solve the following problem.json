    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express a number in base $b$, the highest digit used must be one less than $b$. Since we are looking for the smallest value of $b$ where 62 can be expressed using only three digits, we first want to find the smallest value of $b$ such that $b^2 > 62$. We find that $8^2 = 64$, which is greater than 62. Therefore, $b$ must be less than 8. \n\nNext, we want to determine if 62 can be expressed using only three digits in base $b$. The highest possible digit in base $b$ is therefore $b-1$. Let's start by trying $b=7$. \n\nIn base 7, 62 can be expressed as $7^1 \\cdot 8 + 2 = 54$. This is not equal to 62. Next, let's try $b=6$. \n\nIn base 6, 62 can be expressed as $6^1 \\cdot 10 + 2 = 62$. This shows that 62 can indeed be expressed using only three digits in base 6. \n\nTherefore, the smallest whole number $b$ such that 62 can be expressed in base $b$ using only three digits is $\\boxed{6}$.",
