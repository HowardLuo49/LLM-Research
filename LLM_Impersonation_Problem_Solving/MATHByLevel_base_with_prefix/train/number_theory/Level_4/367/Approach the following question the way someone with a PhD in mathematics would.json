    "solution": "By inspection, we find that  \\begin{align*}\n1\\cdot 1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n2\\cdot 5 &\\equiv1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n4\\cdot 7 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\\\\n8\\cdot 8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}.\n\\end{align*}So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have modular inverses (mod 9). Since no multiple of 0, 3, and 6 can be one more than a multiple of 9, we find that $\\boxed{6}$ of the modulo-9 residues have inverses.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the integers between 0 and 8 inclusive that have an inverse modulo 9, we need to find numbers x such that there exists a number y such that (x * y) mod 9 = 1. In other words, we are looking for integers x that are coprime to 9. \n\nIn this case, we have to check which integers between 0 and 8 do not share any factors with 9, i.e., do not have common divisors other than 1. \n\nIntegers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are coprime to 9, as they are not divisible by 3 (which is a factor of 9). Therefore, there are 6 integers between 0 and 8 inclusive that have an inverse modulo 9.",
