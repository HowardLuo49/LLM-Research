    "solution": "An integer congruent to 1 (mod 9) can be written in the form $9n + 1$ for some integer $n$.  We want to count the number of integers $n$ such that $$ 1 \\le 9n + 1 \\le 200. $$Subtracting 1 from all parts of the inequality, we get $0 \\le 9n \\le 199$.  Dividing by 9 we get $0 \\le n \\le 22\\, \\frac{1}{9}$.  There are $22 - 0 + 1 = \\boxed{23}$ values of $n$ corresponding to positive integers from 1 to 200 inclusive that are congruent to 1 (mod 9).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the numbers congruent to 1 (mod 9), we need to look for numbers in the form of 9n + 1, where n is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe smallest possible value for n is 0, which gives us 9(0) + 1 = 1. The next possible value for n is 1, which gives us 9(1) + 1 = 10. The next possible value for n is 2, which gives us 9(2) + 1 = 19.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that the numbers congruent to 1 (mod 9) are: 1, 10, 19, 28, 37, ..., 190.\n\nTo find the total number of such numbers among the 200 smallest positive integers, we need to consider the largest possible value of n. The largest possible value of n should be the largest integer such that 9n + 1 is less than or equal to 200. This happens when n = 21, which gives us 9(21) + 1 = 190.\n\nTherefore, there are 21 numbers among the 200 smallest positive integers that are congruent to 1 (mod 9).",
