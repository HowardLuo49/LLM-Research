    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the prime factors of $159137$, we can start by checking if it is divisible by small prime numbers.\n\n$159137$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$, so we can check if it is divisible by the next prime number, $5$.\n\n$159137 = 5 \\times 31827$. However, $31827$ is not divisible by $5$, so we need to keep going.\n\n$159137 = 7 \\times 22739$. In this case, $22739$ is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of $159137$ are $7$ and $22739$. The two largest prime factors are $7$ and $22739$, and the positive difference between them is $22739 - 7 = 22732$. \n\nSo, the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of $159137$ is $\\boxed{22732}$.",
