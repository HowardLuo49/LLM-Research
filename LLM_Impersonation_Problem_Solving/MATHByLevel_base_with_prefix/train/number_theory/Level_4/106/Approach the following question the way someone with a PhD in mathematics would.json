    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Base prime representation of a natural number is defined using the exponents of its prime factorization as follows. Each place in a base prime represents a prime number, and it is occupied by the corresponding exponent of that prime, starting on the right side with the smallest prime number and proceeding to the left with the next largest prime number. For instance, since $84 = 7^1 \\times 5^0 \\times 3^1 \\times 2^2$, then $84$ would be written as $1012$ in base prime. What is $225$ written in base prime?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $225$ is $225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$. Since $2$ does not divide into $225$, we treat $2$ as having a $0$ exponent; the next two primes are $3$ and $5$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{220}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the base prime representation of $225$, we first need to factorize $225$ into its prime factors. \n\n$225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$\n\nTherefore, the base prime representation of $225$ would be $2200$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 220?: To find the base prime representation of $225$, we first need to factorize $225$ into its prime factors. \n\n$225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$\n\nTherefore, the base prime representation of $225$ would be $2200$.",
