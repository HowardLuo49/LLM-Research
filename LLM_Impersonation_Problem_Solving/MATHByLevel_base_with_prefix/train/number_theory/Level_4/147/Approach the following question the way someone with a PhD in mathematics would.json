    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Each pack of hot dogs contains 10 hot dogs (no buns), but each pack of hot dog buns contains 8 buns.  Phil buys a number of these packs for a barbecue.  After the barbecue, Phil finds that he has 4 hot dogs left over.  What is the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of packs of hot dogs that Phil bought.  Then $10n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, which reduces to $2n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$.  This congruence tells us that $2n = 8k + 4$ for some integer $k$, or $n = 4k + 2$.  The second smallest positive integer of this form is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the number of packs of hot dogs Phil bought.\n\nSince each pack contains 10 hot dogs, the total number of hot dogs Phil bought is 10x.\n\nSince each pack of buns contains 8 buns, the total number of buns Phil bought is 8x.\n\nSince each hot dog needs one bun, the total number of hot dogs must equal the total number of buns. However, Phil has 4 hot dogs left over, so the total number of hot dogs is 4 more than the total number of buns:\n\n10x = 8x + 4\n\nSolving for x, we find that x = 2.\n\nTherefore, the SECOND smallest number of packs of hot dogs he could have bought is 2.",
