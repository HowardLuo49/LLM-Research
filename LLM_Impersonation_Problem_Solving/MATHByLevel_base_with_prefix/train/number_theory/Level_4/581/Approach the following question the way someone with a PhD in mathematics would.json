    "solution": "First notice that $5^n\\equiv 2^n\\pmod 3$, which should make our computations easier. For $n=1,2,3,4$, we get $2^n\\equiv 2,1,2,1\\pmod 3$ respectively and $n^5\\equiv 1,2,0,1\\pmod 3$ respectively. Since we have a congruent pair at $n=\\boxed{4}$, we don't need to look any further.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest positive integer $n$ satisfying $5^n \\equiv n^5 \\pmod 3$, we first note that $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and $n^5 \\equiv n \\pmod 3$ for any integer $n$.
