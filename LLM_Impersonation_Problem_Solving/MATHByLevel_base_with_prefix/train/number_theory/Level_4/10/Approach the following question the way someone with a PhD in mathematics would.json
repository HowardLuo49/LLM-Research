    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to convert $AAA_4$ to decimal form. \n$AAA_4 = 4^2A + 4A + A = 16A + 4A + A = 21A$\n\nThis can also be expressed as $33_b$, where $b$ is the base we are looking for. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$21A = 3b + 3$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$7A = b + 1$\n\nSince $b$ must be greater than 5, the smallest possible value for $b$ is 6. \nPlugging in $b = 6$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$7A = 6 + 1$\n$7A = 7$\n$A = 1$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible sum $A+b$ is $1+6 = 7$.",
