    "solution": "For the greatest common divisor of 15 and $n$ to be equal to 3, $n$ must be divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5.  In other words, $n$ is divisible by 3, but not by 15.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 100 is 99, so there are $99/3 = 33$ multiples of 3 from 1 to 100.  We must subtract from this the number of multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.\n\nThe greatest multiple of 15 that is less than or equal to 100 is 90, so there are $90/15 = 6$ multiples of 15 from 1 to 100.  Therefore, there are $33 - 6 = \\boxed{27}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 3, but not 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integers $n$ between 1 and 100 such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 15 and $n$ is equal to 3, we can use the property that gcd(a,b) = gcd(a, b - a) for any positive integers a and b.\n\nSince we are looking for the gcd of 15 and $n$ to be 3, it follows that $n$ must be congruent to 3 modulo 15. In other words, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{15}$.\n\nThus, we can find the integers $n$ satisfying this condition by considering the multiples of 15 that are congruent to 3 modulo 15 within the range 1 to 100. These integers are of the form $n = 15k + 3$ for some integer k.\n\nWe can now find the values of k for which $n = 15k + 3$ falls in the range 1 to 100. The smallest value of k that results in $n$ being greater than or equal to 1 is when k = 0, which gives us $n = 3$. The largest value of k that results in $n$ being less than or equal to 100 is when k = 6, which gives us $n = 93.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 integers $n$ between 1 and 100 such that the gcd of 15 and $n$ is equal to 3, namely 3, 18, 33, 48, 63, 78, and 93.",
