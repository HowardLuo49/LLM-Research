    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ such that $n \\equiv -3736 \\pmod{6}$, we can write the equation as $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6}$, since $-3736$ is equivalent to $2$ modulo $6$. \n\nWe know that the remainder when dividing by $6$ can only be $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, or $5$. Therefore, the only possible value for $n$ is $2$. \n\nThus, the integer $n$ that satisfies the congruence $n \\equiv -3736 \\pmod{6}$ is $n = 2$.",
