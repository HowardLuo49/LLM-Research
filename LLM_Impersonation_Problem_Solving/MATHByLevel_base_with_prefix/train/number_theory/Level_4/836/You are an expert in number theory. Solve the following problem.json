    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check only composite numbers:\n\n$\\bullet$ For $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $6$, $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n\n$\\bullet$ For $12$, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 > 12$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The smallest abundant number is 12.\n\nTo determine this, we first find the proper divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. \n\nThe sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12. Therefore, 12 is an abundant number.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 12?: The smallest abundant number is 12.\n\nTo determine this, we first find the proper divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. \n\nThe sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12.
