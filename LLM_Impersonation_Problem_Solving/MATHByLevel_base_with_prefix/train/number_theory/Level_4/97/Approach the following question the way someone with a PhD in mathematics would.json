    "solution": "Since $256=2^8$ the divisors of $256$ are the powers of 2 up to $2^8$. So the sum of the proper factors of 256 is $2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4+2^5+2^6+2^7=\\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of 256, we first need to identify all the divisors of 256. A proper divisor of a number is any divisor excluding the number itself.\n\nThe prime factorization of 256 is 2^8. Therefore, the divisors of 256 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.\n\nThe sum of the proper divisors of 256 is the sum of these divisors excluding 256. Thus, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 256 is 255.",
