    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.  What is the resulting sum, expressed in base 4?",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add the integers 195 and 61 in base 4, we first convert both numbers to base 10. \n\nThe number 195 in base 4 can be written as: 1*(4^3) + 2*(4^2) + 3*(4^1) + 3*(4^0) = 64 + 32 + 12 + 3 = 111 in base 10.\n\nSimilarly, the number 61 in base 4 can be written as: 1*(4^2) + 0*(4^1) + 1*(4^0) = 16 + 0 + 1 = 17 in base 10.\n\nAdding these two numbers together in base 10, we get 111 + 17 = 128.\n\nNow, we need to convert the sum 128 back to base 4. \n\nExpressing 128 in powers of 4, we have: 128 = 1*(4^3) + 2*(4^2) + 0*(4^1) + 0*(4^0) = 1000 in base 4.\n\nTherefore, the resulting sum of 195 and 61 in base 4 is 1000.",
