    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. The integers 195 and 61 are expressed in base 4 and added.  What is the resulting sum, expressed in base 4?",
    "solution": "Since changing the base does not change the underlying quantity being represented, the sum of the base-4 representations of 195 and 61 is the same as the base-4 representation of 195+61.  Recognizing that 195+61=256 is a power of 4, we put 1 in the place whose value is $4^4$ and 0 in the remaining places to obtain the sum $\\boxed{10000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To add integers in different bases, we first need to convert them to the same base. In this case, we will convert both 195 and 61 from base 10 to base 4.\n\nTo convert 195 to base 4, we divide 195 by 4 repeatedly and write down the remainders until the quotient is 0:\n195 \u00f7 4 = 48 remainder 3\n48 \u00f7 4 = 12 remainder 0\n12 \u00f7 4 = 3 remainder 0\n3 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 3\n\nSo, 195 in base 4 is equal to 3033.\n\nTo convert 61 to base 4, we follow the same process:\n61 \u00f7 4 = 15 remainder 1\n15 \u00f7 4 = 3 remainder 3\n3 \u00f7 4 = 0 remainder 3\n\nSo, 61 in base 4 is equal to 133.\n\nNow, we add the two numbers in base 4:\n  3033\n+  133\n-------\n  3202\n\nTherefore, the resulting sum of 195 and 61, expressed in base 4, is 3202.",
