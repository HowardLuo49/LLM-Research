    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. If $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, how many even positive factors does $n$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of even positive factors of $n$, we need to consider the prime factorization of $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since an even number must have at least one factor of 2, the only way a factor of $n$ can be even is if it contains at least one factor of 2. This means that to find the number of even factors, we need to consider the powers of 2 in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\nWe can write $n$ as $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 2^k \\cdot m$ where $k=3$ and $m=3^2 \\cdot 5$. Any factor of $n$ must have the form $2^a \\cdot m$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$ and $m$ is an odd number (meaning it does not contain any factors of 2).\n\nSo, to find the number of even factors of $n$, we need to consider the choices for $a$. Since $a$ can take on 4 values (0, 1, 2, 3), there are 4 possible choices for the power of 2 in the factor. Therefore, $n$ has 4 even positive factors.",
