    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $n$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  An integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we have 3 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and $2$ choices for $c$, for a total of $(3)(3)(2)=\\boxed{18}$ ways to form an even positive factor of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of even positive factors of a number, we need to consider the exponent on the 2 in the prime factorization of the number.\n\nThe prime factorization of $n=2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$ can also be written as $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$.\n\nTo find the number of even positive factors, we should find the total number of factors first. To do this, we add 1 to each of the exponents and multiply these numbers together. Therefore, the total number of factors of $n$ is $(3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the factors that are even. A factor is even if it contains a factor of 2. In this case, we have 3 choices for the power of 2: 0, 1, or 2. This means we have 3 choices for the exponent of 2 in each factor.\n\nTherefore, the number of even positive factors is $3\\cdot3\\cdot2=18$.",
