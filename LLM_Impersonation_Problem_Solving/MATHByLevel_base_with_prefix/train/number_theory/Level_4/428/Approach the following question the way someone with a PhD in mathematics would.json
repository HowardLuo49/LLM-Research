    "solution": "$M=1$, $5$, or $6$ since no other digits have the property that the units digit of $M\\times M$ is $M$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $MM\\times M=NPM$ is $66\\times6=\\boxed{396}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to express the given information algebraically. \n\nLet's first denote the two-digit integer $MM$ as $10M+M=11M$, where $M$ is the digit. \nNext, we know that when $11M$ is multiplied by the one-digit integer $M$, the result is the three-digit integer $NPM$. \nThis can be written as: $(11M)\\cdot M = NPM$. \n\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get: $11M\\cdot M = 11M^2$. \nTherefore, $11M^2 = NPM$. \n\nSince $NPM$ is a three-digit number, we can express it as $100N + 10P + M$. \nThis gives us the equation: $11M^2 = 100N + 10P + M$. \n\nGiven that $M$ is a one-digit integer, the maximum value of $M$ is 9. \nSubstituting $M=9$ into the equation, we get: $11\\cdot 9^2 = 891$ \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of $NPM$ is $\\boxed{891}$.",
