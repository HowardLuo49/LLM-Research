    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6, we first need to understand the properties of abundant numbers. An abundant number is a positive integer that satisfies the condition that the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) is greater than the number itself.\n\nLet's denote the sum of divisors of a positive integer n (including 1 and n itself) as \u03c3(n). Therefore, n is an abundant number if \u03c3(n) > 2n.\n\nBy considering the divisors of the number n, we can see that \u03c3(12) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28, which is greater than 2*12 = 24. Hence, 12 is an example of an abundant number.\n\nNow, since we are looking for the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6, we need to consider the factors of 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, any multiple of 6 will have divisors that are also divisors of 6.\n\nTo find the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6, we can start by considering the positive integers greater than 12 that are not multiples of 6. By checking each number, we compare the sum of divisors with the number itself.\n\nWe find that the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6 is 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. The sum of divisors, \u03c3(20), is 42 which is greater than 2*20 = 40. Therefore, 20 is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6.",
