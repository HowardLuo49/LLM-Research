    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The base $9$ representation of a positive integer is $AB$ and its base $7$ representation is $BA$. What is the integer expressed in base $10$?",
    "solution": "Converting the two expressions to base $10$, it follows that the given positive integer is equal to $9A + B$ and is also equal to $7B + A$. Setting these two expressions equal, we have that $$9A+B = 7B+A \\Longrightarrow 8A = 6B \\Longrightarrow 4A = 3B.$$ Thus, $B$ is divisible by $4$. Since $B$ is a digit in base $7$, it follows that $B$ is either equal to $0$ or $4$. However, we can discard the case $B = 0$, since its base $7$ representation is no longer a two-digit number. Thus, $B = 4$ and $A = 3$. In base $10$, the number is $9 \\cdot 3 + 4 = 7 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{31}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to recognize that the base representations $AB$ and $BA$ are actually expressing the number in different bases. The base $9$ representation $AB$ means $10A + B$ in base $10$ and the base $7$ representation $BA$ means $10B + A$ in base $10$. \n\nEquating these two expressions, we get:\n\n$10A + B = 10B + A$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$9A = 9B$\n\nDividing both sides by $9$, we get $A = B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $9$ and base $7$ respectively, they must be between $0$ and $8$. So the only possible solution is $A = B = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the integer expressed in base $10$ is $10A + B = 10(4) + 4 = 44$.",
