    "solution": "To solve this question we need to think about what the units digit of a prime number could be. A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit. The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97. Their sum is $\\boxed{418}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we will first identify all of the two-digit prime numbers greater than 12 but less than 99.\n\nThe two-digit prime numbers greater than 12 and less than 99 are: 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.\n\nNext, we will check if the prime numbers above remain prime when their two digits are interchanged:\n\n- 13 becomes 31 (which is also prime)\n- 17 becomes 71 (which is also prime)\n- 31 remains prime\n- 37 remains prime\n- 71 remains prime\n- 73 remains prime\n- 79 remains prime\n- 97 remains prime\n\nTherefore, the two-digit primes that are greater than 12 but less than 99 and still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 37, and 79.\n\nThe sum of these prime numbers is: 13 + 17 + 37 + 79 = 146.\n\nSo, the sum of all two-digit primes that are greater than 12 but less than 99 and still prime when their two digits are interchanged is 146.",
