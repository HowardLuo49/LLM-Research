    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all of the two-digit primes that are greater than 12 but less than 99 and are still prime when their two digits are interchanged?",
    "solution": "To solve this question we need to think about what the units digit of a prime number could be. A two-digit prime could end in 1, 3, 7 or 9; thus, we need to examine primes only in the 10s, 30s, 70s and 90s because when the digits are switched the tens digit will become the units digit. The primes greater than 12 but less than 99 that are still prime when their two digits are interchanged are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 and 97. Their sum is $\\boxed{418}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this question, we first need to identify all the two-digit primes that satisfy the given conditions. \n\nLet's consider a two-digit prime number in the form of 10a + b, where 'a' represents the digit in the tens place and 'b' represents the digit in the units place. For the prime number to remain unchanged when its two digits are interchanged, the number should be a palindrome, i.e., a = b. Additionally, the number should be greater than 12 but less than 99.\n\nSince the number is a prime, the digits a and b can only take certain values to form a prime number. By considering different combinations of a and b, the prime numbers that satisfy the given conditions are:\n\n11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, and 79.\n\nNow, to find the sum of all these prime numbers, we simply add them up:\n\n11 + 13 + 17 + 31 + 37 + 71 + 73 + 79 = 322\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the two-digit primes that are greater than 12 but less than 99 and remain prime when their two digits are interchanged is 322.",
