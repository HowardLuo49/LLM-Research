    "solution": "Write $3^{2004}$ as $(3^{4})^{501}$.  Since the units digit of $3^4=81$ is 1, the units digit of any power of $3^4$ is $\\boxed{1}$ as well.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $3^{2004}$, we need to consider the patterns of units digits in powers of 3. \n\nThe units digit of $3^1$ is 3, the units digit of $3^2$ is 9, the units digit of $3^3$ is 7, the units digit of $3^4$ is 1, and then the pattern repeats every 4 powers. \n\nSince 2004 is divisible by 4, we know that the units digit of $3^{2004}$ will be the same as the units digit of $3^4$, which is 1. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of $3^{2004}$ is 1.",
