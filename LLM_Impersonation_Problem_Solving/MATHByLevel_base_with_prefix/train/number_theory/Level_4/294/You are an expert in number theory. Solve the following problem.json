    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of $4125$. $4125= 11 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. Thus, we want $n!$ to have a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and $3$ factors of $5$. The largest prime in the factorization is $11$, so $n \\ge 11$. The exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of 11! is only 2, since only the factors 5 and 10 are divisible by 5. Similarly, 12!, 13!, and 14! only have 2 fives in their prime factorizations. Since $15!$ contains a factor of $11$, a factor of $3$, and three factors of $5$, the least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer $n$ such that $4125$ is a factor of $n!$, we need to consider the prime factorization of $4125 = 3^1 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 11^1$.\n\nIn $n!$, the number of factors of $3$ is given by the highest power of $3$ less than or equal to $n$ (also known as the greatest integer value less than or equal to $\\frac{n}{3}$).
