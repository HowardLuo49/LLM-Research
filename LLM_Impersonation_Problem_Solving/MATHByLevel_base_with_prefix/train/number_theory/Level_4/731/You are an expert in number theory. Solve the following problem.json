    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Eleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
    "solution": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ be the number of cookies Eleanor made. We can write two congruences:\n$$x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$$\n$$x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nFrom the first congruence, we can express $x$ as $11a + 4$ for some integer $a$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get:\n$$11a + 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$4a \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$$\n$$a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$$\n\nSo, $a = 7b + 1$ for some integer $b$. Therefore, $x = 11(7b + 1) + 4 = 77b + 15$. To find the possible values of $x$ less than $100$, we can plug in integers for $b$ and check the values of $x$:\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= 1: x = 92 \\\\\nb &= 2: x = 169\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the possible numbers of cookies Eleanor could have made are $92$ and $169$, and their sum is $\\boxed{261}$.",
