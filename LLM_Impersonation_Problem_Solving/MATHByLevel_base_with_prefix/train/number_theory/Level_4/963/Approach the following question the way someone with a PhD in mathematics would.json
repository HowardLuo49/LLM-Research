    "solution": "Let $a$ be a common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na&\\equiv 2\\pmod 3\\\\\na&\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer such that $a=2+3n$. Substituting this into $(2)$ yields \\[2+3n\\equiv 3\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $5$. Then $n\\ge 5\\implies a=2+3n\\ge 17$. $17$ satisfies the original congruences, so it is the smallest common term. Subtracting $17$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\na-17&\\equiv -15\\equiv 0\\pmod 3\\nonumber\\\\\na-17&\\equiv -14\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\\nonumber\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,7)$, we get $a-17\\equiv 0\\pmod{3\\cdot 7}$, that is, $a\\equiv 17\\pmod{21}$.\n\nSo all common terms must be of the form $17+21m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. Note that any number of the form also satisfies the original congruences. The largest such number less than $500$ is $17+21\\cdot 22=\\boxed{479}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest value less than 500 that is common to both arithmetic progressions, we can first express the terms of each progression in terms of their general forms.\n\nThe first progression can be expressed as $a_n = 2 + 3(n-1)$ for $n \\geq 1$.\nThe second progression can be expressed as $b_n = 3 + 7(n-1)$ for $n \\geq 1$.\n\nTo find the common values, we need to solve $a_n = b_m$ for integers $n$ and $m$. Equating the expressions for $a_n$ and $b_m$, we have:\n$2 + 3(n-1) = 3 + 7(m-1)$.\n\nSimplifying this equation gives $3n - 3 = 7m - 4$. Rearranging terms, we have $3n = 7m + 1$. This can be rewritten as $n = \\frac{7m+1}{3}$, which means $7m+1$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nThe largest value less than 500 that satisfies this condition is $m = 70$, which gives $n = 147$. Substituting $m = 70$ into the expression for $b_m$ gives the largest common value less than 500 as $b_{70} = 3 + 7(70-1) = 486$.\n\nTherefore, the largest value less than 500 that is common to both arithmetic progressions is $\\boxed{486}$.",
