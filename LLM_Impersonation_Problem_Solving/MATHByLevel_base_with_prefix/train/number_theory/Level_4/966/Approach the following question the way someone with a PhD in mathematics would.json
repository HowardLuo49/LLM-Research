    "solution": "To express the number $0.42\\overline{153}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $1000x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&1000x &=& 421&.53153153153\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.42153153153\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&999x &=& 421&.11\n\\end{array}$$This shows that $0.42\\overline{153} = \\frac{421.11}{999} = \\frac{42111}{99900}$.\n\nSo, $x=\\boxed{42111}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question like someone with a PhD in mathematics, we need to understand that the bar over the decimal digits indicates that the digits repeat infinitely.
