    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$, we first need to determine the values of $A$ and $B in their respective bases.\n\nIn base 5, the digit $A$ can take values from 0 to 4. Therefore, the number represented by $AA_5$ is $5A + A = 6A$.\n\nIn base 7, the digit $B$ can take values from 0 to 6. Therefore, the number represented by $BB_7$ is $7B + B = 8B$.\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest base-10 integer that can be expressed as both $6A$ and $8B$. This means that $6A = 8B$. \n\nTo simplify, we can divide both sides by 2 to get $3A = 4B$. The smallest values that satisfy this equation are $A = 4$ and $B = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ is $44_5 = 4(5) + 4 = 24_{10}$ and $33_7 = 3(7) + 3 = 24_{10}$.",
