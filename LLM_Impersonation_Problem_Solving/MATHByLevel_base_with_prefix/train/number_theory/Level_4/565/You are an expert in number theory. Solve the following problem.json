    "solution": "We can rewrite $AA_5$ and $BB_7$ to get \\begin{align*}\n5A+A&=7B+B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6A&=8B\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n3A&=4B.\n\\end{align*}We can see that the smallest possible values for $A$ and $B$ are $A=4$ and $B=3$. So the integer can be expressed as $44_5=33_7=\\boxed{24_{10}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as $AA_5$ and $BB_7, we first need to understand the meaning of the representation.\n\nIn base-5, the number $AA_5$ represents $A * 5^1 + A * 5^0 = 5A + A = 6A$ in base-10.\n\nSimilarly, in base-7, the number $BB_7$ represents $B * 7^1 + B * 7^0 = 7B + B = 8B$ in base-10.\n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as both $AA_5$ and $BB_7 must be a common multiple of 6 and 8. The smallest common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24.\n\nSo, the smallest base-10 integer that can be represented as both $AA_5$ and $BB_7 is 24.",
