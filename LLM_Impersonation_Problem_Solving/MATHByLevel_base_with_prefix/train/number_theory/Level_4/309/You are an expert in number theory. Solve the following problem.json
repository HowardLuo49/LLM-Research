    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to rewrite the base $b$ number $23_b$ as a standard base 10 number:\n\n$23_b = 2b + 3 = b^2 + k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$b^2 - 2b + (3 - k) = 0$\n\nFor $23_b$ to be a perfect square, the discriminant of this quadratic equation, $b^2 - 2b + (3 - k)$, must be a perfect square. The discriminant is given by $4 - 4(3-k) = -4k + 16$.\n\nTo find the smallest integer $b$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $-4k + 16$ is a perfect square. We can start by setting $-4k + 16$ equal to the squares of consecutive integers until we find a solution:\n\n$-4k + 16 = 1 \\implies k = 3$\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $b$ for which $23_b$ is a perfect square is $b = 4$.\n\nTherefore, $23_4 = 2(4) + 3 = 11$.",
