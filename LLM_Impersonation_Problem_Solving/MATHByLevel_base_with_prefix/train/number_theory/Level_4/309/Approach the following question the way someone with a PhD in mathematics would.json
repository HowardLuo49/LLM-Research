    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "Since $23_b = 2b + 3$ and $b > 3$, $23_b$ can be any odd integer greater than $2(3) + 3 = 9$.  We are looking for the next smallest odd perfect square, which is $5^2 = 25$.  Since $2b + 3 = 25$, $b = \\boxed{11}$ is our answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To address this question, we first need to convert the given base $b$ number $23_b$ into standard base 10 form. \n\nGiven that $23_b = 2b + 3$, we want to find the integer $b$ such that $2b + 3 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. \n\nRearranging the equation, we have $k^2 - 2b = 3$. We can rewrite this as $k^2 = 2b + 3$. \n\nFor $k^2$ to be a perfect square, $2b + 3$ must be a perfect square as well. Starting with the smallest $b$ greater than 3, we can test values of $b$ until we find a square number. \n\nFor example:\n\n- $b = 4$ yields $2(4) + 3 = 11$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 5$ yields $2(5) + 3 = 13$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 6$ yields $2(6) + 3 = 15$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 7$ yields $2(7) + 3 = 17$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 8$ yields $2(8) + 3 = 19$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 9$ yields $2(9) + 3 = 21$ which is not a perfect square.\n- $b = 10$ yields $2(10) + 3 = 23$ which is a perfect square with $k = 5$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $b > 3$ for which the base $b$ number $23_b$ is a perfect square is 10.",
