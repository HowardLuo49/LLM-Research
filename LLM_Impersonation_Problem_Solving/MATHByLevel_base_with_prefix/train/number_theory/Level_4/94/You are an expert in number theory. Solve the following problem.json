    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$. Therefore, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\nThe largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Therefore, there are $8$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\nHowever, we cannot simply add those two numbers together because there are numbers that are both a perfect cube and a perfect square. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it needs to be a $2 \\cdot 3 =6$th power. The largest 6th power less than $555$ is $2^6=64$, so there are $2$ 6th powers less than $555$.\nTherefore, there are $23+8-2=\\boxed{29}$ integers that are either a perfect cube or perfect square.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the perfect squares first. The largest perfect square less than $555$ is $23^2=529$, and the smallest perfect square greater than $555$ is $24^2=576$. Hence, there are $23$ perfect squares less than $555$.\n\nNext, let's consider the perfect cubes. The largest perfect cube less than $555$ is $7^3=343$, and the smallest perfect cube greater than $555$ is $8^3=512$. Hence, there are $7$ perfect cubes less than $555$.\n\nHowever, we have counted the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes twice. The only such number is $1$, which is both $1^2$ and $1^3$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers less than $555$ that are either a perfect square or a perfect cube is $23+7-1=\\boxed{29}$.",
