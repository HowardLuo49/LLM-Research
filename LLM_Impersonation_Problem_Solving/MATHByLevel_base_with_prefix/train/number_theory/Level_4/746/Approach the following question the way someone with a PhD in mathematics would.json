    "solution": "Since $-3737 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}$, the integer $n$ we seek is $n = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the integer $n$ satisfying the congruence $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$, we use the definition of modular congruence. \n\nBy definition, $n \\equiv -3737 \\pmod{8}$ means that $n + 3737$ is divisible by 8. In other words, there exists an integer $k$ such that $n + 3737 = 8k$. \n\nRearranging the equation, we have $n = 8k - 3737$. \n\nSince $0 \\le n \\le 7$, we need to find the value of $n$ within that range. Substituting $n = 8k - 3737$ into the inequality $0 \\le n \\le 7$, we get $0 \\le 8k - 3737 \\le 7$. \n\nFrom this inequality, we can solve for $k$ to find the corresponding values of $n$. \n\n$8k - 3737 \\ge 0 \\implies 8k \\ge 3737 \\implies k \\ge 467.125$. Since $k$ must be an integer, we have $k \\ge 468$. \n\n$8k - 3737 \\le 7 \\implies 8k \\le 3744 \\implies k \\le 468$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of $k$ are integers in the range $468 \\le k \\le 468$. \n\nSubstitute $k=468$ into the equation $n = 8k - 3737$: \n\n$n = 8(468) - 3737 = 3744 - 3737 = 7$. \n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies the given congruence is $n = 7$.",
