To test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$. If you want to check that a number between 900 and 950 is prime with this rule, what is the largest prime divisor you need to test?",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To check whether a number between 900 and 950 is prime using this rule, we need to find the largest prime divisor less than or equal to $\\sqrt{950} \\approx 30.82$. \n\nThe largest prime less than or equal to 30 is 29. Therefore, we only need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to 29 to determine whether a number between 900 and 950 is prime.",
