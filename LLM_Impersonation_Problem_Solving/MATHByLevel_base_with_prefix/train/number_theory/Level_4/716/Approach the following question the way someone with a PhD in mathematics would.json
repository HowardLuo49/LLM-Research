To test whether an integer, $n$, is prime, it is enough to be sure that none of the primes less than or equal to the square root of $n$ divide $n$. If you want to check that a number between 900 and 950 is prime with this rule, what is the largest prime divisor you need to test?",
    "solution": "You need to test the primes less than a number between $\\sqrt{900}=30$ and $\\sqrt{950}<31$, so the largest prime divisor you need to test is $\\boxed{29}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest prime divisor that needs to be tested for primality of a number between 900 and 950, we follow the approach outlined in the problem statement.\n\nGiven that the number is between 900 and 950, the square root of the largest possible number in this range (950) is approximately 30.82. Therefore, we only need to test for prime divisors up to the largest prime number less than or equal to 30.\n\nThe prime numbers less than or equal to 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nHence, the largest prime divisor that needs to be tested for the primality of a number between 900 and 950 is 29.",
