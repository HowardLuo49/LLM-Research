    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the other number be x. We know that the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor. \n\nSo, we have:\n\nLCM(180, x) = (180 * x) / GCD(180, x)\n3780 = (180 * x) / 18\n3780 = 10 * x\nx = 378\n\nTherefore, the other number is 378.",
