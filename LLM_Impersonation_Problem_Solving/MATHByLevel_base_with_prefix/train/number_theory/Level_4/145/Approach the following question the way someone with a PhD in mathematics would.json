    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two numbers be represented as a and b. From the given information, we have:\n\na * b = LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b) = 3780 * 18 = 68040\na = 180\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\n180 * b = 68040\nb = 68040 / 180\nb = 378\n\nTherefore, the other number is 378.",
