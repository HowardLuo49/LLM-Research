    "solution": "Since $9 = 3^2$, we can convert directly to base 3 by expanding each base 9 digit into two base 3 digits:   \\begin{align*} 8_9 &= 22_3 \\\\ 1_9 &= 01_3 \\\\ 3_9 &= 10_3 \\end{align*}  Putting the base 3 digit pairs together, we get $813_9 = \\boxed{220110_3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $813_9$ to base 3, we first need to write out the place values of each digit in base 9. \n\n$813_9 = 8 \\cdot 9^2 + 1 \\cdot 9^1 + 3 \\cdot 9^0$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$813_9 = 648 + 9 + 3$\n\nTherefore, $813_9 = 660_9 = 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 2 \\cdot 3^2 + 0 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0$\n\nSimplifying this further, we get:\n\n$813_9 = 2200_3$\n\nTherefore, $813_9$ in base 3 is $2200_3$.",
