    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the residue of $-811 \\pmod{24}$, we first find the residue of $811 \\pmod{24}$ and then take the negative of that residue.\n\nSince $811 = 33\\cdot 24 + 19$, we have $811 \\equiv 19 \\pmod{24}$.\n\nTherefore, the residue of $-811 \\pmod{24}$ is the negative of $19$, which is $-19 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{24}$.\n\nSo, the residue of $-811 \\pmod{24}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
