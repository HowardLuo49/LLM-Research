    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Determine the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$. Your answer should be an integer in the range $0,1,2,\\ldots,22,23$.",
    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24).",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$, we first note that $-811$ is equivalent to $-19$ modulo $24$. We can reduce $-19$ by adding multiples of $24$ until we get a non-negative residue. \n\nAdding $24$ to $-19$ gives $5$, which is a valid residue modulo $24$. Therefore, the residue of $-811$ modulo $24$ is $5$.",
