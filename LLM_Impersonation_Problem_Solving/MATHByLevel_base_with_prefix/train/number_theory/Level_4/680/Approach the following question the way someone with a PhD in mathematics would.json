    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The product of two positive three-digit palindromes is 436,995. What is their sum?",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 436,995: $436,995=3^4\\cdot5395=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot1079=3^4\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot83$. We see that $3^2\\cdot83=747$ is a three-digit palindrome, and the product of the remaining powers of primes is a palindrome as well: $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot13=585$. Thus, the desired sum is $747+585=\\boxed{1332}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two positive three-digit palindromes be denoted as $abc$ and $cba$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are their respective digits. \n\nSince their product is 436,995, we can write the equation:\n\n$(100a+10b+c)(100c+10b+a)=436995$\n\nExpanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:\n\n$10000ac+100(10ab+10bc) + 10(b^2)+110(ba+cb)=436995$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$10000ac+1000ab+1000bc+10b^2+110ba+110bc=436995$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$10001ac+1010ab+1110bc+10b^2=436995$\n\nGiven that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits from 1 to 9, we can iterate through possible values to find that $a=3$, $b=7$, and $c=5$ satisfy the equation.
