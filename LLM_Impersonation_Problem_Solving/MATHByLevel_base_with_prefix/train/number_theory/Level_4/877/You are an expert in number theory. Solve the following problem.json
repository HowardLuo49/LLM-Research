    "solution": "$$ \\text{gcd}(7560, 8400) = 840 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 \\cdot 7^1 $$The common divisors of 7560 and 8400 are the divisors of their GCD: $$ t(840) = (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = \\boxed{32}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to prime factorize 8400 and 7560 to find their divisors.\n\n8400 = 2^4 * 3 * 5^2 * 7\n7560 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5 * 7\n\nTo find the common divisors, we take the intersection of the sets of prime factors of both numbers. Thus, the common prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\nThe number of positive divisors of 8400 can be calculated by multiplying the exponents of each prime factor by one more than the exponent, and then multiplying these results together. Thus, the number of positive divisors of 8400 is (4+1) * (1+1) * (2+1) * (1+1) = 60.\n\nSimilarly, the number of positive divisors of 7560 can be calculated as (3+1) * (3+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 32.\n\nSince the common divisors of 8400 and 7560 are determined by their common prime factors, we can multiply the multiplicities of the common prime factors to find the number of common divisors. Thus, the number of common divisors is (1+1) * (3+1) * (1+1) * (1+1) = 32.\n\nTherefore, 8400 and 7560 have 32 positive divisors in common.",
