    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by trying to build the largest number using only digits 3 and 2 that add up to 11. \n\nIf we start with the leftmost digit, we want to use as many 3's as possible while keeping the sum at 11. \n\nSo we start with the digit 3. Our remaining sum is 8. Next, we can fit another 3. So now our remaining sum is 5. Adding another 3 would exceed our target sum, so we need to use 2's now. \n\nWe need 5 more to reach the target sum, so we'll use two 2's. Our number so far is 3322.\n\nNow, we have two 3's and two 2's. To maximize the number, we need to put the remaining digits in descending order. So, the largest number that meets this condition is $\\boxed{3322}$.",
