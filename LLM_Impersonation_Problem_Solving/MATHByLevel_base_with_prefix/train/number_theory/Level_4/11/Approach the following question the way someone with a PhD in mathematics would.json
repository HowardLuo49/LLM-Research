    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest number, all of whose digits are 3 or 2, and whose digits add up to $11$?",
    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's consider the possible digit combinations that can add up to 11. Since the number must consist only of digits 2 and 3, the only possible combinations are 2222 or 3222. \n\nNow, let's calculate the value of each combination:\n\n- For 2222: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\n- For 3222: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9\n\nTherefore, the largest number that satisfies the given conditions is 3222.",
