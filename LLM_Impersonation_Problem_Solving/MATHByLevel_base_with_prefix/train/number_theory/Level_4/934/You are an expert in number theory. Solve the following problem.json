    "solution": "Since $\\gcd(m,n) = 12$, both $m$ and $n$ are divisible by 12.  Then $10m$ is divisible by $10 \\cdot 12 = 120$, and $15n$ is divisible by $12 \\cdot 15 = 180$.  Since 60 divides both 120 and 180, $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ must be at least 60.\n\nIf we set $m = n = 12$, then $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(12,12) = 12$, and $\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120,180) = 60$, which shows that the value of 60 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $d = \\gcd(m,n) = 12$. This means that $m = 12a$ and $n = 12b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nTherefore, $10m = 120a$ and $15n = 180b$.\n\nNow, let's find the greatest common divisor of $120a$ and $180b$. Using the properties of the greatest common divisor, we have:\n\n$\\gcd(10m,15n) = \\gcd(120a, 180b) = 60\\gcd(2a, 3b)$.\n\nSince $\\gcd(2a,3b)$ must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, the smallest possible value for $\\gcd(10m,15n)$ is $\\boxed{60}$.",
