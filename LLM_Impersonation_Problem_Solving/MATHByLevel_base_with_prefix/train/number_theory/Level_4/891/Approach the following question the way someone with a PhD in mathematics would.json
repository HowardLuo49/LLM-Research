    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Karlanna places 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.  There is more than one box, and each box contains more than one marble.  For how many values of $m$ can this be done?",
    "solution": "If the number of marbles in each box is $n$, then $mn = 600$, so $m$ and $n$ are both divisors of 600. $$ 600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(600) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 24. $$However, $m > 1$ and $n > 1$, so $m$ can be neither 1 nor 600.  This leaves $24 - 2 = \\boxed{22}$ possible values for $m$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let $n$ be the number of marbles in each box. We know that $m$ is the total number of boxes, so we have $n \\cdot m = 600$.\n\nFrom here, we can analyze the factors of 600 to determine the possible values of $m$. The prime factorization of 600 is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. Since each box contains more than one marble, $n > 1$ and $m > 1$. This means that $n$ and $m$ must both be divisors of 600 that are greater than 1.\n\nThe divisors of 600 (excluding 1) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100, 120, 150, 200, 300. For each of these divisors, we can find the corresponding values of $m$ by dividing 600 by the divisor.\n\nTherefore, there are 22 possible values of $m$ for which Karlanna can place 600 marbles into $m$ total boxes such that each box contains an equal number of marbles.",
