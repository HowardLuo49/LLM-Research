    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5, we need to find the largest multiple of 5 in base 8 that is less than 1000 in base 8.\n\nIn base 8, the digit 5 represents the number 5. To find the largest multiple of 5 less than 1000 in base 8, we start by dividing 1000 by 5, which equals 200 in base 8 (400 in base 10). Therefore, the largest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5 is 200 in base 8.\n\nSo, the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5 is 200 in base 8.",
