    "solution": "The greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer is $777_8$, which is equal to $7 \\cdot 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8 + 7 = 511$.  This number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, so we subtract 1, to get $\\boxed{776_8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "In base 8, the only digit values are from 0 to 7. To find the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5, we need to find the largest number that can be expressed as 3 base 8 digits (from 000 to 777) and is divisible by 5.\n\nTo find this number, we need to convert the number 5 into base 8. In base 8, 5 is equal to 5. Therefore, we are looking for the largest 3-digit base 8 number that ends with 0, 5, or 2.\n\nThe largest 3-digit base 8 number that ends with 5 is 765 (7*8^2 + 6*8^1 + 5*8^0 = 493). Since 765 is not divisible by 5, we move on to the next largest number that ends with 2. The largest number that ends with 2 is 772 (7*8^2 + 7*8^1 + 2*8^0 = 506). Since 506 is divisible by 5, the greatest 3-digit base 8 positive integer that is divisible by 5 is 772 in base 8.",
