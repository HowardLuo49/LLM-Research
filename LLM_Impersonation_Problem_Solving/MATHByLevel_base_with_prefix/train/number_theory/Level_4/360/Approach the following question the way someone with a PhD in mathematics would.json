    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Eleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
    "solution": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use modular arithmetic. Let's denote the number of girls as n = 11. \n\nThe distance between each throw is 3 girls. Therefore, the first throw from Ami to the 5th girl skips 3 girls, and the second throw from the 5th girl to the 9th girl also skips 3 girls. \n\nLet's denote the positions of the girls as integers from 0 to n-1, where Ami is at position 0. The position of the girl after skipping 3 girls can be represented as (position + 3) mod n. \n\nStarting with Ami at position 0, the positions of each throw are as follows:\n\n0 (Ami) -> 5 -> 9 -> 1 -> 6 -> 10 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 11 (wrap around to 0)\n\nTherefore, the ball returns to Ami after 11 throws. \n\nIn conclusion, a total of 11 throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami.",
