    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Eleven girls are standing around a circle. A ball is thrown clockwise around the circle. The first girl, Ami, starts with the ball, skips the next three girls and throws to the fifth girl, who then skips the next three girls and throws the ball to the ninth girl. If the throwing pattern continues, including Ami's initial throw, how many total throws are necessary for the ball to return to Ami?",
    "solution": "If we number the girls 1, 2, 3, $\\dots$, so that Ami is number 1, and she passes the ball first to girl number 5, then the numbers of the girls with the ball are 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 1.  Hence, the ball must be thrown $\\boxed{11}$ times before it returns to Ami.",
    "gpt_response": "Since each girl skips three girls before throwing the ball, the throwing pattern follows a sequence of skipping 3 girls and throwing to the next girl. This sequence repeats every 4 girls. \n\nSo, in order for the ball to return to Ami, it must complete a full cycle of 11 girls. \n\nSince 11 is not divisible by 4, the ball will not return to Ami after completing a full cycle of 11 girls. \n\nTherefore, Ami's initial throw is the only throw necessary for the ball to return to her. \n\nSo, the total number of throws necessary for the ball to return to Ami is 1.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 11?: Since each girl skips three girls before throwing the ball, the throwing pattern follows a sequence of skipping 3 girls and throwing to the next girl.
