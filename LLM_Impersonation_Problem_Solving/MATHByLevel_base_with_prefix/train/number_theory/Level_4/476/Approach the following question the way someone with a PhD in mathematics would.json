    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by all of these numbers then $n-1$ is a multiple of all of these.  We compute the LCM of these numbers as  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{lcm}(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)&=\\text{lcm}(5,6,7,8,9)\\\\\n&=\\text{lcm}(5,7,8,9)\\\\\n&=5\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\\\\n&=2520.\n\\end{align*} The smallest $n>1$ that satisfies $2520\\mid n-1$ is $n=\\boxed{2521}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer that satisfies all of the given conditions, we can start by considering the least common multiple (LCM) of the divisors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The LCM of these numbers is 2520.\n\nSince the number we are looking for leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by each of these numbers, the number must be of the form 2520k + 1, where k is a positive integer. \n\nTo find the least positive integer greater than 1 that satisfies this, we can start by trying k = 1. When we substitute k = 1 into the expression 2520k + 1, we get 2521. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer greater than 1 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by each of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is 2521.",
