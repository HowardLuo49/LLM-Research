    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The base-10 numbers 217 and 45 are multiplied. The product is then written in base-6. What is the units digit of the base-6 representation?",
    "solution": "The units digit of a positive integer when expressed in base 6 is the same as the remainder when the integer is divided by 6.  For example, the number $1502_6$ is equal to $1\\cdot 6^3+5\\cdot 6^2+0\\cdot 6+2$, and 6 divides every term except the units digit, 2.  When 217 is divided by 6, the remainder is 1.  When 45 is divided by 6, the remainder is 3.  Therefore, the product of 217 and 45 has a remainder of $1\\cdot 3=\\boxed{3}$ when divided by 6.",
    "gpt_response": "To calculate the product of 217 and 45 in base-10, we first multiply the unit digits of the numbers, 7 and 5, to get 35. Since this is greater than 9, we carry over the tens place to get 15. Next, we multiply the tens digit of 217, 1, by the unit digit of 45, 5, to get 5. We then add the carry-over to get 20.
