    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A school has between 150 and 200 students enrolled. Every afternoon, all the students come together to participate in gym class. The students are separated into six distinct sections of students. If one student is absent from school, the sections can all have the same number of students. What is the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school?",
    "solution": "If there are $s$ students, then $s-1$ must be divisible by 6. In other words, we want to find the sum of all values of $s$ for which $s-1\\equiv 0\\pmod{6}$. The multiples of 6 in the given range are 150, 156, ..., 198, so the possible values of $s$ are 151, 157, ..., 199. Recalling that the sum of an arithmetic series is  \\[\n\\frac{(\\text{first term}+\\text{last term})(\\text{number of terms})}{2},\n\\]we find that these integers sum to $(151+199)(9)/2=\\boxed{1575}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of students in each section as x. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 6x.\n\nIf one student is absent, the number of students in each section can be represented as (6x - 1)/6 = x - 1. This implies that the number of students in each section when one student is absent is one less than the original number of students in each section.\n\nWe can now form an equation based on this information:\n6x - 1 = 6(x - 1)\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n6x - 1 = 6x - 6\n\nRearranging the equation, we find:\nx = 5\n\nSubstitute x back into the total number of students equation:\n6(5) = 30\n\nTherefore, when the school has 29 students, each section will have 5 students, and if one student is absent from school, each section will have 4 students.\n\nNow let's find the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school between 150 and 200.\n\nThe total number of students, 30, is the first solution where each section has 5 students.
