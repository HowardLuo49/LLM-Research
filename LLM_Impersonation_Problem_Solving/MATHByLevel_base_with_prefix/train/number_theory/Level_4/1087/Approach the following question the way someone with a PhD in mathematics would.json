    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{3}{26}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.1\\overline{153846}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a six-digit repeating block. We want to find the $99$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $99$ is divided by $6$ is $3$. Therefore, the $100$th digit is the third digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal, we first need to divide $3$ by $26$. When we do so, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{26} = 0.11538461538461538461538461538461...$$\n\nFrom this decimal representation, we can see that the decimal digits $1$, $1$, $5$, $3$, $8$, $4$, $6$, $1$, repeat in a cycle of length $6$. \n\nTo find the $100$th digit after the decimal point, we can divide $100$ by the length of the repeating cycle, which is $6$. This gives a quotient of $16$ with a remainder of $4$. Therefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point will be the $4$th digit in the repeating cycle, which is $3$.\n\nTherefore, the $100$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{3}{26}$ is expressed as a decimal is $3$.",
