    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we can think about the numbers modulo 17, as the pattern repeats every 17 stones. Let's consider the remainder when each original stone number is divided by 17:\n\n- Stone 1: 1 mod 17 = 1\n- Stone 2: 2 mod 17 = 2\n- Stone 3: 3 mod 17 = 3\n- Stone 4: 4 mod 17 = 4\n- Stone 5: 5 mod 17 = 5\n- Stone 6: 6 mod 17 = 6\n- Stone 7: 7 mod 17 = 7\n- Stone 8: 8 mod 17 = 8\n- Stone 9: 9 mod 17 = 9\n\nAs the original stones 1 to 9 are counted in order from left to right, they will be counted as 1 to 9, which correspond to the first digit assigned to that stone. \n\nNow, to find out which original stone is counted as 99, we need to find the stone for which the remainder when dividing by 17 is 15 (since 99 is congruent to 15 modulo 17). Among the stones 1 to 9, we see that only stone 9 yields a remainder of 15 when divided by 17.\n\nTherefore, the original stone that is counted as 99 in this pattern is stone number 9, and the corresponding first digit assigned to that stone is $\\boxed{9}$.",
