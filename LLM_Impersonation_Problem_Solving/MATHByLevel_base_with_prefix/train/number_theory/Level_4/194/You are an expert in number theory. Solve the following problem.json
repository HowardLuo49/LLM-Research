    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s. Since $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, we know that $T$ is divisible by 12. \n\nThe smallest positive integer that is divisible by 12 and whose digits are only 0s and 1s is 111111, which equals $12*9259$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is $\\boxed{9259}$.",
