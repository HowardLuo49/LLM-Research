    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $T$ be a positive integer whose only digits are 0s and 1s. If $X = T \\div 12$ and $X$ is an integer, what is the smallest possible value of $X$?",
    "solution": "Since $T$ is divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.  Hence, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 and its last two digits are divisible by 4.  By inspection, we see that $T$ must end in 00 and therefore the smallest such $T$ is 11100.  Calculating, $X = \\boxed{925}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest possible value of $X$, we need to consider the divisibility rule for 12. In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since $T$ consists of only 0s and 1s, the sum of its digits will always be either 0 or 1. Thus, $T$ can only be divisible by 3 if it contains a single digit 1.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the number formed by the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4. Since $T$ consists of only 0s and 1s, the only valid two-digit numbers are 00, 01, 10, and 11. Among these, only 12 is divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $T$ that satisfies both conditions is 12. Dividing 12 by 12 yields $X = 1$, which is the smallest possible value.",
