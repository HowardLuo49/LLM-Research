A second sequence begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$. In the range of $1$ to $100$, what is the largest number common to both sequences?",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.",
    "gpt_response": "The $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence can be represented as $a + (n-1)d$, where $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.\n\nFor the first sequence with first term $1$ and common difference $6$, the $n$th term is $1 + 6(n-1) = 6n - 5$.\n\nFor the second sequence with first term $4$ and common difference $7$, the $n$th term is $4 + 7(n-1) = 7n - 3$.\n\nTo find the largest number common to both sequences, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $6n - 5 = 7n - 3$.\n\nSolving this equation, we get $n = 2$. Therefore, the largest number common to both sequences in the range of $1$ to $100$ is the $2$nd term of the first sequence, which is $6(2) - 5 = \\boxed{7}$.",
