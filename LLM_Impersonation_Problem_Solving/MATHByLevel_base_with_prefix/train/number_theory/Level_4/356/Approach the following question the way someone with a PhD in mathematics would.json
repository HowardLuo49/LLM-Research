    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An $\\textit{abundant number}$ is a positive integer, the sum of whose distinct proper factors is greater than the number. (The $\\textit{proper factors}$ of a number are all of its factors except the number itself.) How many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers?",
    "solution": "First we note that no prime number is abundant since the sum of the proper factors of any prime is 1. Analyzing the remaining numbers, we find that 12 ($1+2+3+4+6=16>12$), 18 ($1+2+3+6+9=21>18$), 20 ($1+2+4+5+10=22>20$), and 24 ($1+2+3+4+6+8+12=36>24$) are abundant numbers. Thus, $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many numbers less than 25 are abundant numbers, we must first calculate the sum of the proper factors for each number less than 25.\n\nFor example, consider the number 12. The proper factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these factors is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, which is greater than 12. Therefore, 12 is an abundant number.\n\nWe can follow this process for each number less than 25 to determine if it is an abundant number or not. \n\nThe numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers are: 12, 18, 20, and 24.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ numbers less than 25 that are abundant numbers.",
