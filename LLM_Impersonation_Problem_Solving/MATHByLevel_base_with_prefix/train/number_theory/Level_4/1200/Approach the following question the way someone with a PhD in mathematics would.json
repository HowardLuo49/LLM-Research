    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The prime factorization of 2160 is $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$. How many of its positive integer factors are perfect squares?",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares, we must consider the exponents in the prime factorization of 2160. \n\nThe integer factors that are perfect squares must have even exponents for all the prime factors. This is because when we take the square root of a number, we need to divide the exponents by 2 to get an integer result.\n\nIn the prime factorization of 2160, the exponents are 4 for 2, 3 for 3, and 1 for 5. To find the number of positive integer factors that are perfect squares, we need to find all possible combinations of even exponents for each prime factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, we have 0, 2, and 4 as possible even exponents, giving us 3 choices.\nFor the prime factor 3, we have 0 and 2 as possible even exponents, giving us 2 choices.\nFor the prime factor 5, we have 0 as the only possible even exponent, giving us 1 choice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integer factors that are perfect squares for 2160 is the product of these choices: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. \n\nSo, there are 6 positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares.",
