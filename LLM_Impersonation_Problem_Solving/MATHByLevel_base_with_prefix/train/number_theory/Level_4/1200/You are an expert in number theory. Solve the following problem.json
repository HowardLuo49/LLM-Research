    "solution": "The prime factorization of a positive integer factor of 2160 is of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot 5^c$ where $0\\leq a\\leq 4$, $0\\leq b\\leq 3$, and $0\\leq c\\leq 1$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  Therefore, we are free to choose $a$ from the set $\\{0,2,4\\}$ and $b$ from the set $\\{0,2\\}$.  In total, we have $3\\times 2=\\boxed{6}$ choices for the exponents in the prime factorization of a perfect square factor of 2160.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares, we need to consider the powers of its prime factors.\n\nPrime factorization of 2160: $2^4 \\times 3^3 \\times 5$\n\nFor a factor to be a perfect square, each prime factor in its prime factorization must have an even exponent. This means that the powers of 2 and 3 in the factor must be even, while the power of 5 must be either even or odd.\n\nThere are 5 possible choices for the power of 2: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (even numbers less than or equal to 8). Similarly, there are 4 possible choices for the power of 3: 0, 2, 4, and 6.\n\nFor the power of 5, we have 2 choices: 0 (even) or 1 (odd).\n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of 2160 that are perfect squares is:\n5 (choices for the power of 2)  x 4 (choices for the power of 3) x 2 (choices for the power of 5) = 40\n\nSo, there are 40 positive integer factors of 2160 that are perfect squares.",
