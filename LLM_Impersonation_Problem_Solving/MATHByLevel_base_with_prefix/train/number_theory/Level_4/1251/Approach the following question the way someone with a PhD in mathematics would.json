    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The number $m$ is a three-digit positive integer and is the product of the three distinct prime factors $x$, $y$ and $10x+y$, where $x$ and $y$ are each less than 10. What is the largest possible value of $m$?",
    "solution": "If $10x+y$ is prime, then $y$ cannot be 2 or 5.  So if $x$ and $y$ are prime digits, then $y$ must be 3 or 7 and $x$ must be one of the other three prime digits.  Checking the six resulting cases, we find that the prime numbers of the form $10x+y$ where $x$ and $y$ are both prime digits are 23, 53, 73, and 37.  The values of $xy(10x+y)$ for these four numbers are 138, 795, 1533, and 777.  The largest of these values which is less than 1000 is $\\boxed{795}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $m$, we need to maximize the prime factors $x$, $y$, and $10x+y$. \n\nSince $x$ and $y$ are both less than 10, we should choose the largest possible prime numbers for $x$ and $y$ within that range. The largest prime number less than 10 is 7, so let $x=7$. \n\nNext, we need to choose the largest prime number less than 10 for $y$. Since $y$ must be distinct from $x$, we cannot choose 7 again. The next largest prime number less than 10 is 5, so let $y=5$. \n\nFinally, we need to find the largest possible value for $10x+y$. Substituting $x=7$ and $y=5$, we have $10(7)+5=75$. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $m$ is the product of $x=7$, $y=5$, and $10x+y=75$, which is $7 \\times 5 \\times 75 = 2625$. \n\nHence, the largest possible value of $m$ is 2625.",
