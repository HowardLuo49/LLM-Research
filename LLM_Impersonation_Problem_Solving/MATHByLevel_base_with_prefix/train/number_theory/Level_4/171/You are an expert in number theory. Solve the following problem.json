    "solution": "We start by writing out some powers of five modulo 7. \\begin{align*}\n5^1 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^3 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^4 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^5 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^6 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have that $5^6 \\equiv 1$ modulo 7. Thus, $5^{2010} \\equiv (5^6)^{335} \\equiv 1^{335} \\equiv \\boxed{1}$ modulo 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when it is divided by 7, we can use Euler's theorem. \n\nEuler's theorem states that if $a$ and $n$ are coprime (meaning they have no common factors except 1), then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function, which gives the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are coprime with $n$. \n\nSince 5 and 7 are coprime, we have $\\phi(7) = 6$.
