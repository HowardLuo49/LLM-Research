    "solution": "We start by writing out some powers of five modulo 7. \\begin{align*}\n5^1 &\\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^2 &\\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^3 &\\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^4 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^5 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\\\\n5^6 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we have that $5^6 \\equiv 1$ modulo 7. Thus, $5^{2010} \\equiv (5^6)^{335} \\equiv 1^{335} \\equiv \\boxed{1}$ modulo 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when divided by 7, we can use Euler's theorem which states that for any integer $a$ and positive integer $n$, if $a$ and $n$ are coprime (i.e., they share no common factors other than 1), then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function that gives the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are coprime to $n$.\n\nIn this case, we have $a = 5$ and $n = 7$, which are coprime. Euler's totient function for a prime number $p$ is just $p-1$. Therefore, $\\phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6$. \n\nNow, we can find $5^{2010} \\pmod{7}$ as follows:\n$5^{2010} \\equiv 5^{6(335)+0} \\equiv (5^6)^{335} \\equiv 1^{335} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$\n\nSo, the remainder of $5^{2010}$ when divided by 7 is 1.",
