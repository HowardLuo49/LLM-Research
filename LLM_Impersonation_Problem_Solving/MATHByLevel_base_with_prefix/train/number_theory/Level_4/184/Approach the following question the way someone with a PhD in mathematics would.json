    "solution": "We have $$2^{2005}\\times5^{2007}\\times3=(2\\times5)^{2005}\\times5^2\\times3=75\\times10^{2005},$$ so the sum of the digits is $7+5=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$, we first simplify the expression by using the properties of exponents. \n\nNotice that $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} = 10^{2005}$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to $10^{2005} \\times 3 = 3 \\times 10^{2005}$. \n\nSince $3 \\times 10^{2005}$ is equal to $3$ followed by 2005 zeros, the sum of the digits in this decimal representation is simply 3. \n\nHence, the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of $2^{2005} \\times 5^{2007} \\times 3$ is 3.",
