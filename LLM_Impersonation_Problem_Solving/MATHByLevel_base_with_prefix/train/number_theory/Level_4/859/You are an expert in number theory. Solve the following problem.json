    "solution": "If the prime factorization of an integer is given as $p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdot p_3^{a_3}\\cdot...$ the number of divisors will be: $$(a_1+1)(a_2+1)(a_3+1)...$$ So, we need to factor 14 in a similar manner to the expression above.  We can write: $$14=(13+1)=(1+1)(6+1)$$ The smallest integer in the first case will be $2^{13}$, and the smallest in the second case will be $2^6\\cdot 3^1=192$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{192}$ is clearly the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first consider how the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization. \n\nIf we have a number n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime numbers and a1, a2, ..., ak are positive integers, then the number of divisors of n is given by (a1+1)(a2+1)...(ak+1).\n\nSo, if we want a number with exactly 14 positive divisors, we need to find a number that has a prime factorization such that the product of the exponents in the prime factorization is 13. The prime factorization that comes to mind is 2^6 * 3^2, as (6+1)(2+1) = 7 * 3 = 21, which is more than 14. \n\nTo find the smallest number with exactly 14 divisors, we can adjust the exponents like so: 2^2 * 3^6 = 4 * 729 = 2916. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer with exactly 14 positive divisors is 2916.",
