    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the sum of all of the odd divisors of $180$?",
    "solution": "First, we find the prime factorization of $180$ to be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Note that the odd divisors of 180 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5)$ yields 6 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b$ appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 180 is $(1+3+9)(1+5)=13 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{78}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all of the odd divisors of $180$, we first need to factorize $180$ into its prime factors. In this case, $180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$. \n\nThe odd divisors of $180$ will not have any powers of $2$ in their factorization. Therefore, the odd divisors will be of the form $3^a \\times 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ can be $0, 1,$ or $2$ since $180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2\\times 5$. \n\nThe odd divisors of $180$ are $1, 3, 5, 9, 15,$ and $45$. The sum of these odd divisors is $1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 15 + 45 = 78$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all of the odd divisors of $180$ is $78$.",
