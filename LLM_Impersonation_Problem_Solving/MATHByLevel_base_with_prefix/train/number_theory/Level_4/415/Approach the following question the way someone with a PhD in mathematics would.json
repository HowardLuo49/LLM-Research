    "solution": "Notice that by the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + 8 = (n+2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)$ is an integer divisible by $n+2$. Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9, n+2) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9 - (n^3 + 8), n+2) \\\\ \n& = \\text{gcd}\\,(1,n+2) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 3^2$ and $n + 2$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFirst, we divide $n^3 + 3^2$ by $n + 2$ to get a quotient and remainder. We have:\n\n$n^3 + 3^2 = (n + 2)(n^2 - 2n + 4) + 1$\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $n^3 + 3^2$ and $n + 2$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $n + 2$ and $1$. Since $1$ is relatively prime to any positive integer $n > 2^3$, the greatest common divisor is $1$.",
