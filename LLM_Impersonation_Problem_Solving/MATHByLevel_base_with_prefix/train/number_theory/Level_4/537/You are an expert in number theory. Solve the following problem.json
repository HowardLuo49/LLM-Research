    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\\cdot45$. Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of odd factors of 180, we first need to prime factorize 180.\n\n180 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5\n\nTo find the number of odd factors, we can ignore the power of 2 in the prime factorization because any factor that contains a factor of 2 will be even.\n\nSo we are only interested in the odd factors that are in the form of 3^a * 5^b.\n\nFor the power of 3, we have 3^0, 3^1, and 3^2, for a total of 3 possibilities.\n\nFor the power of 5, we have 5^0 and 5^1, for a total of 2 possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the total number of odd factors of 180 is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo there are 6 odd whole numbers that are factors of 180.",
