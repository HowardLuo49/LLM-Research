    "solution": "Factoring out the highest power of 2 that divides 180, we get $180=2^2\\cdot45$. Thus, the odd factors of 180 are all the factors of $45=3^2\\cdot5^1$, which has $(2+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{6}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many odd whole numbers are factors of 180, we first need to find the prime factorization of 180. \n\nWe can break down 180 into its prime factors by using a method called prime factorization. The prime factorization of 180 is:\n\n180 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5\n\nNow, a factor of a number must be a combination of its prime factors. In this case, an odd factor must contain at least one 3 and/or one 5, since 2 is an even number. \n\nTo find the number of odd factors of 180, we can use the rule that for each prime factor, we have 2 choices: either include it or exclude it in a factor. \n\nFor the prime factor 3, we have 3 choices (include 3, do not include 3, include it twice), and for the prime factor 5, we also have 2 choices (include 5, do not include 5). \n\nThus, the total number of odd factors of 180 is:\n\n3 (choices for 3) \u00d7 2 (choices for 5) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 odd whole numbers that are factors of 180.",
