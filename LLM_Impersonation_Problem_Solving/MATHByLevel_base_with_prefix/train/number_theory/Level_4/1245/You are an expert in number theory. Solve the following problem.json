The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where the first and second terms are 1 and each term after that is the sum of the previous two terms. What is the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 8?",
    "solution": "We can look at the terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 8.   \\begin{align*}\nF_1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_2 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_3 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_4 &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_5 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_6 &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_7 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_8 &\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_9 &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{10} &\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{11} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{12} &\\equiv 0\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{13} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{14} &\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{15} &\\equiv 2\\pmod{8}, \\\\\nF_{16} &\\equiv 3\\pmod{8}.\n\\end{align*}Since $F_{13}$ and $F_{14}$ are both 1, the sequence begins repeating at the 13th term, so it repeats every 12 terms.  Since the remainder is 4 when we divide 100 by 12, we know $F_{100}\\equiv F_4\\pmod 8$.  Therefore the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by 8 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when the $100$th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by $8$, let's first look for a pattern in the remainders of the Fibonacci numbers when divided by $8$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n1 \\pmod{8} & : 1 \\\\\n2 \\pmod{8} & : 1 \\\\\n3 \\pmod{8} & : 2 \\\\\n5 \\pmod{8} & : 5 \\\\\n8 \\pmod{8} & : 0 \\\\\n13 \\pmod{8} & : 5 \\\\\n21 \\pmod{8} & : 5 \\\\\n34 \\pmod{8} & : 2 \\\\\n55 \\pmod{8} & : 3 \\\\\n89 \\pmod{8} & : 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom the list above, we can see that every 6th Fibonacci number has a remainder of $0$ when divided by $8$. Therefore, by finding the remainder of $100$ when divided by $6$, we can determine the remainder of the $100$th Fibonacci number when divided by $8$.\n\nSince $100 \\div 6 = 16$ with a remainder of $4$, the $100$th Fibonacci number will have the same remainder as the $4$th Fibonacci number.
