    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place are divisible by $15$?",
    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$, we need to consider the divisibility rule for $15$. A number is divisible by $15$ if it is divisible by both $3$ and $5$.\n\nSince the number must have a $5$ in the units place, it must be divisible by $5$. This means that the tens digit of the number must be even (to ensure divisibility by $5$).\n\nTo ensure divisibility by $3$, the sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by $3$. Since we already have the digit $5$ in the units place, we need to choose the hundreds and tens digits such that the sum of the digits is divisible by $3$, given that the tens digit is even.\n\nLet the hundreds digit be $a$ and the tens digit be $b$. We have:\n\n$5 + b + a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $b$ can be $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, or $8$, as $a$ and $b$ are both integers between $0$ and $9$ inclusive.\n\nSo, there are $5$ choices for the tens digit. For the hundreds digit, we have $9$ choices ($1$ through $9$) because it cannot be $0$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$ is $5 \\times 9 = 45$.",
