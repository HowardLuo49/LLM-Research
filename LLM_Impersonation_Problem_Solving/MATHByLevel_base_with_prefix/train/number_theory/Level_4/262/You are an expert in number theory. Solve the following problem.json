    "solution": "Odd multiples of 5 have a 5 in the units place, while even multiples of 5 have a 0 in the units place. Multiples of 15 are multiples of 5, so we look at how many three-digit multiples of 15 are odd to find how many have a 5 in the units place. The three-digit multiples of 15 range from 105 to 990, or $15\\times7$ to $15\\times 66$. So there are $66-7+1=60$ three-digit multiples of 15. Half of them will be odd, so there are 30 odd, three-digit multiples of 15. There are $\\boxed{30}$ positive, three-digit integers with a 5 in the units place that are divisible by 15.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place that are divisible by $15$, we first need to understand the properties of numbers divisible by $15$.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by $15$, it must be divisible by both $3$ and $5$. To be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of $3$. To be divisible by $5$, the units digit must be $0$ or $5$.\n\nSince we are looking for three-digit integers with a $5$ in the units place, the other two digits can be any combination of numbers from $0$ to $9$.\n\nConsidering the divisibility rule for $3$, the sum of the three digits must be divisible by $3$. From $0$ to $9$, the possible choices for the other two digits are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9$.\n\nWe can form numbers with a $5$ in the units place by pairing $5$ with any of the possible choices for the tens digit.
