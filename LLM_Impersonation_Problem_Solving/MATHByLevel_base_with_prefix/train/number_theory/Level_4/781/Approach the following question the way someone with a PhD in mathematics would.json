    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction representation of the decimal $0.428125$, we note the repeating pattern in the decimal expansion after the initial $0.4281$. The pattern is $25$, so we can express $0.428125$ as $\\frac{4281}{10000} + \\frac{25}{99000}$. \n\nWe then add these two fractions to get a single fraction in simplest terms. The common denominator is $10000 \\times 99000 = 990000000$, so the sum of the fractions is $\\frac{4281 \\times 99000 + 25 \\times 10000}{990000000} = \\frac{424118625}{990000000}$. Note that this is not in simplest terms as the numerator $424118625$ is divisible by $25$. \n\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by $25$, we get the fraction $\\frac{16964745}{39600000}$. Therefore, $a = 16964745$ and $b = 39600000$, and $a + b = 16964745 + 39600000 = 56564745$. \n\nSo, the sum of the positive integers $a$ and $b$ in simplest terms representation of $0.428125$ is $56564745$.",
