    "solution": "The prime factorization of 240 is $2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5$. We want $c$ to be as small as possible, so $c=2$. Now we have $a\\cdot b=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5=120$. For the maximum $b$, we seek the minimum $a$ while $b<a$. If $b<a$ then $a\\cdot b<a^2$, so $120<a^2$. That means $a$ is at least 11. However, 11 is not a factor of 240. The least factor of 240 greater than 11 is $2^2\\cdot3=12$. So the minimum $a$ is 12 and that makes the maximum $b=\\frac{2^3\\cdot3\\cdot5}{2^2\\cdot3}=2\\cdot5=\\boxed{10}$.",

The volume of the box is given by the formula $V = abc$.\n\nSince $a,b,$ and $c$ are integers with $1<c<b<a$, we can write $a = c + x$, $b = c + y$, where $x,y > 0$.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the box can be rewritten as:\n$V = (c+x)(c+y)c = c^3 + cx + cy + xy = 240$.\n\nWe are trying to maximize the value of $b = c+y$. Since $c$ must be an integer factor of 240, we can start by finding the integer factors of 240.
