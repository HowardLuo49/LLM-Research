The greatest common divisor of two integers is $(x+2)$ and their least common multiple is $x(x+2)$, where $x$ is a positive integer. If one of the integers is 24, what is the smallest possible value of the other one?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \\[\\frac{(x + 2) \\cdot x(x + 2)}{24} = \\frac{x(x + 2)^2}{24}.\\]To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.\n\nThis expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, or 3, but when $x = 4$, this expression is $4 \\cdot 6^2/24 = 6$.\n\nNote that that the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24 is 6, and $x + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$.  The least common multiple is 24, and $x(x + 2) = 4 \\cdot (4 + 2) = 24$, so $x = 4$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To start, we know that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers evenly. Therefore, if the GCD of the two integers is $(x+2)$, we can express the two integers as $24k$ and $(x+2)k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. Given that the LCM of the two integers is $x(x+2)$, we can set up the equation:\n\n$24k(x+2)k = x(x+2)$\n\nExpanding and simplifying this equation gives us:\n\n$24k^2x + 48k^2 = x^2 + 2x$\n\nWe also know that one of the integers is 24. Therefore, we can substitute $24k$ in place of one of the integers, which gives us the equation:\n\n$24k^2x + 48k^2 = 24^2$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n$24k^2x + 48k^2 = 576$\n\nDividing by 24 to get rid of the coefficient in front of $x$, we have:\n\n$k^2x + 2k^2 = 24$\n\nSubstituting $x = 1$ (the smallest possible positive integer) into the equation, we find:\n\n$k^2 + 2k^2 = 24$\n\n$3k^2 = 24$\n\n$k^2 = 8$\n\n$k = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is $(x+2)k = (1+2)2\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$.",
