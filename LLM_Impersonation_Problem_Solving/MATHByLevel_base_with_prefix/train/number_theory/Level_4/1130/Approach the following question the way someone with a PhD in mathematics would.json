    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many factors of 8000 are perfect squares?",
    "solution": "Any factor of $8000=2^6\\cdot5^3$ is in the form $2^a\\cdot5^b$ for $0\\le a\\le6$ and $0\\le b\\le3$. To count the number of perfect square factors, we must count the factors of $2^6\\cdot5^3$ that have $a=0$, $2$, $4$ or $6$ and $b=0$ or $2$. This gives $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{8}$ perfect square factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares, we first need to find the prime factorization of 8000. \n\nFirst, we note that 8000 = 2^5 * 5^3. \n\nTo find the number of factors that are perfect squares, we need to consider each prime factor raised to a power that is a multiple of 2. For 2, we have the powers: 0, 2, 4, where each of these corresponds to a perfect square. For 5, we have the powers: 0, 2, where each of these corresponds to a perfect square.\n\nThus, for each prime factor, we have (3 choices for the power of 2) * (2 choices for the power of 5) = 6 possible combinations for perfect squares.\n\nTherefore, the number of factors of 8000 that are perfect squares is 6.",
