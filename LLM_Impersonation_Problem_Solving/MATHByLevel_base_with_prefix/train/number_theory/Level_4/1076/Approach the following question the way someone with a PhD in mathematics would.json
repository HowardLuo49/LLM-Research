    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of the last two digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $07, 49, 43, 01, 07, 49, 43, 01,\\ldots$ . The cycle of the last two digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 numbers long: 07, 49, 43, 01. Thus, to find the tens digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=0$ or 1 corresponds to the tens digit 0, and $R=2$ or 3 corresponds to the units digit 4). Since $2005\\div4=501R1$, the tens digit of $7^{2005}$ is $ \\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$, we can first consider the pattern of the tens place digits of powers of 7. \n\nWe know that the last digit of $7^n$ repeats in a cycle of 4 for $n \\geq 1$. Specifically, the unit digit alternates between the values 7, 9, 3, 1, and then repeats. \n\nTherefore, we can find the remainder of $2005$ when divided by 4. Since $2005 = 4 \\times 501 + 1$, the remainder is 1. This means that the digit in the units place of $7^{2005}$ is the same as the digit in the units place of $7^{1}$, which is 7.\n\nNext, we can consider the tens place digit of powers of 7. The tens place digit also follows a pattern which repeats in a cycle of 20 for $n \\geq 1$. The pattern of tens place digits of powers of 7 is as follows: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 8, 6,  2, 5, 1, 3, 7, and then repeats. \n\nSince the remainder of $2005$ when divided by 20 is 5 (as $2005 = 20 \\times 100 + 5$), the digit in the tens place of $7^{2005}$ is the same as the digit in the tens place of $7^{5}$, which is 0. \n\nTherefore, the digit in the tens place when $7^{2005}$ is expressed in decimal notation is 0.",
