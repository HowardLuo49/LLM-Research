    "solution": "We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^2 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^3 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n2^4 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^5 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^6 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n&\\hphantom{\\text{ leaves a re}}\\vdots\n\\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nIn this case, $p=7$ is a prime number and $2$ is not divisible by $7$. Since $7$ is prime, $2^{6} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, we can express $2^{2005}$ as $(2^{6})^{334}\\times 2^{1}$. Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we have:\n\n$2^{2005} \\equiv (2^{6})^{334}\\times 2 \\equiv 1^{334}\\times 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7 is 2.",
