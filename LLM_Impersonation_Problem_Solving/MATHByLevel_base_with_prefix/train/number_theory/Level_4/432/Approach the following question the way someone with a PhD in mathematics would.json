    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. How many three-digit perfect squares are palindromes?",
    "solution": "The possible units digits of a perfect square are 0 ($0^2$), 1 ($1^2$, $9^2$), 4 ($2^2$, $8^2$), 9 ($3^2$, $7^2$), 6 ($4^2$, $6^2$), and 5 ($5^2$). Clearly, a three-digit perfect square with 0 as the units digit is not a palindrome because its hundreds digit cannot be 0. The only perfect square palindrome with 1 as the units digit is $11^2=121$; the only perfect square palindrome with 4 as the units digit is $22^2=484$; the only perfect square palindrome with 6 as the units digit is $26^2=676$; no perfect square palindrome has 9 or 5 as the units digit. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ perfect squares that are palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To find three-digit palindromic perfect squares, we first note that a perfect square must have an odd number of digits, as a square of a number with an even number of digits will have double the number of digits. Therefore, we are only looking for perfect squares of 3-digit numbers.\n\nLet us represent a 3-digit number as $xyz$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ represent the hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. For a number to be a palindrome, it must be of the form $xyx$. Therefore, we are looking for perfect squares of numbers in the form $xyx$.\n\nThe general form of a 3-digit number of the form $xyx$ is $101x + 10y$. Squaring this number, we get:\n\n$(101x + 10y)^2 = 10201x^2 + 2020xy + 100y^2$\n\nSince we are looking for three-digit numbers, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be between 1 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the perfect squares must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. $10201x^2 + 2020xy + 100y^2$ is a perfect square.\n2. $101x + 10y$ is a 3-digit number.\n\nBy iterating through all possible values of $x$ and $y$, we can determine the number of three-digit palindromic perfect squares.",
