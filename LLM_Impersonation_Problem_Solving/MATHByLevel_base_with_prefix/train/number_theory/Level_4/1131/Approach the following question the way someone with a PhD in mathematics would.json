    "solution": "We begin by computing the remainder of some small powers of $7$. As $7^0 = 1, 7^1 = 7,$ and $7^2 = 49$, then $7^3 = 49 \\cdot 7 = 343$ leaves a remainder of $43$ after division by $100$, and $7^4$ leaves the remainder that $43 \\cdot 7 = 301$ does after division by $100$, namely $1$. The sequence of powers thus repeat modulo $100$ again. In particular, the remainder that the powers of $7$ leave after division by $100$ is periodic with period $4$. Then, $7^{2010} = 7^{4 \\cdot 502 + 2}$ leaves the same remainder as $7^2$ does after division by $100$, which is $\\boxed{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nWe can start by finding the remainder when $7$ is divided by $100$. We can write $7 \\equiv 7 \\mod 100$. \n\nNext, we can find $7^2$ by squaring $7$ and taking the remainder when divided by $100$. \n$7^2 = 49 \\equiv 49 \\mod 100$. \n\nContinuing this process, we find that:\n$7^3 = 7 \\times 49 = 343 \\equiv 43 \\mod 100$\n$7^4 = 7 \\times 43 = 301 \\equiv 1 \\mod 100$\n$7^5 = 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\equiv 7 \\mod 100$\n\nSince the remainders start to repeat after the fourth exponent, we can conclude that $7^{2010}$ has the same remainder as $7^2$ when divided by $100$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $7^{2010}$ is divided by $100$ is $\\boxed{49}$.",
