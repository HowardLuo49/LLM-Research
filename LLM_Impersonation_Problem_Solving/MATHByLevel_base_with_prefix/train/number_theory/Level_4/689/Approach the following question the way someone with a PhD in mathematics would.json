    "solution": "An integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7 can be written in the form $7k+6$.\n\n$1000$ is the smallest four-digit integer, so we want to solve the inequality $7k+6 \\ge 1000$. This inequality has solution $k \\ge 142$, so since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value for $k$ is $142$. As a result, the smallest four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is $7(142) + 6 = \\boxed{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7, we need to determine the smallest positive integer n such that n is congruent to 6 mod 7 and n is a four-digit number. \n\nSince n is congruent to 6 mod 7, we can express n in the form n = 7k + 6 for some integer k. To find the smallest four-digit integer that satisfies this condition, we can start with the smallest possible value of k that yields a four-digit number. \n\nThe smallest possible value of k is 142, as this gives us n = 7(142) + 6 = 1000. This is the smallest four-digit integer that is equivalent to 6 mod 7. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive four-digit integer equivalent to 6 mod 7 is 1000.",
