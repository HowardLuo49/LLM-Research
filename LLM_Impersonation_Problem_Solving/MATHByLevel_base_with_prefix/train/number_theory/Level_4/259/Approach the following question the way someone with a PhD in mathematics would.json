    "solution": "Converting from a decimal to a fraction, we obtain $0.abc = \\frac{abc}{1000} = \\frac{abc}{2^3\\cdot5^3} = \\frac{1}{y}$. Since $0<y\\le9$ and $y$ divides into $1000$, $y$ must equal one of $1,2,4,5$ or $8$. Notice that $y\\neq1$ because then $abc = 1000$, which is impossible as $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits. So, breaking down the remaining possibilities: \\begin{align*}\ny&=2 \\Rightarrow abc = 2^2\\cdot5^3 = 500 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 5+0+0=5 \\\\\ny&=4 \\Rightarrow abc = 2\\cdot5^3 = 250 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+5+0=7 \\\\\ny&=5 \\Rightarrow abc = 2^3\\cdot5^2 = 200 \\Rightarrow a+b+c = 2+0+0 = 2 \\\\\ny&=8 \\Rightarrow abc = 5^3 = 125 \\Rightarrow a+b+c =1+2+5 = 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value of $a+b+c$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, we can express the decimal number $0.abc$ as a fraction in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$. This can be done by noting that $0.abc = \\frac{a}{10} + \\frac{b}{100} + \\frac{c}{1000}$. This can be further simplified to $\\frac{100a + 10b + c}{1000}$.\n\nGiven that $0.abc = \\frac{1}{y}$ for some integer $y$ such that $0 < y \\leq 9$, we can set up the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{100a + 10b + c}{1000} = \\frac{1}{y}$\n\nCross multiplying, we get $1000 = y(100a + 10b + c)$. \n\nSince $y$ is a digit and $0 < y \\leq 9$, we want to maximize the sum $a+b+c$. To do this, we can try different values of $y$ starting from $y=9$. \n\nWhen $y=9$, we have $1000 = 9(100a + 10b + c)$. Simplifying, we get $1000 = 900a + 90b + 9c$, which simplifies to $100 = 10a + b + 0.1c$. \n\nIn order to maximize $a+b+c$, we should assign the largest possible value to $a$ while keeping $b$ and $c$ as small as possible. This leads to $a=9$, $b=1$, and $c=0$. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $a+b+c$ is $9+1+0=10$.",
