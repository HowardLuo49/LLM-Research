    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $8$ if and only if the number formed from its last three digits is divisible by $8$.  Thus, the number of possibilities for the last three digits is equal to the number of three-digit multiples of $8$.  Since $1000 = 8\\cdot 125$, we find that there are $125$ such multiples.  Since the thousands digit of our four-digit integer must be nonzero, there are $9$ possibilities for the thousands digit.  Altogether, $9 \\cdot 125 = \\boxed{1125}$ four-digit integers are divisible by $8$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many positive four-digit integers are divisible by 8, we need to first establish the range within which these integers lie. \nA four-digit integer ranges from 1000 to 9999. \n\nNext, we need to determine the divisibility rule for 8. A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits of the number form a multiple of 8.\n\nTo count the number of ways the last three digits can form a multiple of 8, we use the principle of combinations. \n\nThere are 10 choices for the hundreds place (0-9), 10 choices for the tens place (0-9), and 10 choices for the ones place (0-9). This gives us a total of 10x10x10 = 1000 possible combinations for the last three digits.\n\nFinally, since the first digit cannot be 0 and must be a positive integer (1-9), we multiply the number of possible combinations by 9 (since there are 9 choices for the first digit).\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive four-digit integers divisible by 8 is: 1000 x 9 = 9000.",
