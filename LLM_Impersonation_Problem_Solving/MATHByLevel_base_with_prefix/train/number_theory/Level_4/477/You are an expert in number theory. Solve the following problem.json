A magic square is an array of numbers in which the sum of the numbers in each row, in each column, and along the two main diagonals are equal.

    "solution": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$.",

Since $S$ is the sum of each row, we must have $S \\in \\{1,2,4,8,16,32\\}$.\n\nNow we can try each of these values for $S$ and check if it is possible to express $32$ as $10b^3 + 17b^2 + 22b + 32$.
