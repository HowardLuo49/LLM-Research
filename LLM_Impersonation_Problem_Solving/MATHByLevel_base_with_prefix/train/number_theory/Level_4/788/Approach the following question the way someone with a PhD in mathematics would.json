    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics would approach this question, the first step is to find the modular inverse of 73 modulo 74. This involves finding an integer $x$ such that $73x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{74}$. \n\nBy observing that $73 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{74}$, we can simplify the equation to $(-1)x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{74}$. Multiplying both sides by $-1$ yields $x \\equiv -1 \\pmod{74}$. Therefore, the modular inverse of 73 modulo 74 is $-1$.\n\nHowever, we are asked to represent the residue modulo 74 as a non-negative integer between 0 and 73. To achieve this, we can add $74$ to the residue $-1$ to obtain the equivalent residue in the desired range. Thus, the residue of $73^{-1} \\pmod{74}$ as a non-negative integer between 0 and 73 is $73$.",
