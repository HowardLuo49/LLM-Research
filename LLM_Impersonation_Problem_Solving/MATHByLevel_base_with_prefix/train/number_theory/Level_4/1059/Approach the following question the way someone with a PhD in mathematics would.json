    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what base-6 digit $d$ is $2dd5_6$ divisible by the base 10 number 11? (Here $2dd5_6$ represents a base-6 number whose first digit is 2, whose last digit is 5, and whose middle two digits are both equal to $d$).",
    "solution": "We write $2dd5_6$ in base 10 to get $2dd5_6=2\\cdot 6^3+d\\cdot 6^2 +d\\cdot 6 + 5= 437 + 42d$. We can subtract $39\\cdot 11$ from this quantity without changing whether it is divisible by 11. This subtraction yields $437 + 42d-429 = 8 + 42d$. We can subtract $33d$ from this quantity, again not changing whether it is divisible by 11, leaving $8+9d$. Now we try the possible values $d=0,1,2,3,4,5$ for a base-6 digit, and we find that only $d=\\boxed{4}$ results in a number which is divisible by 11.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if $2dd5_6$ is divisible by 11 in base 10, we need to convert this number to base 10. \n\nIn base 6, the number $2dd5_6$ can be expressed as $2(6^3) + d(6^2) + d(6) + 5$. Simplifying this expression, we get $2(216) + 36d + 6d + 5 = 432 + 42d + 5 = 437 + 42d$.\n\nFor $2dd5_6$ to be divisible by 11 in base 10, the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions must be divisible by 11. \n\nGiven that the digits $2d+5$ (odd positions) must be equal to the digits $d$ (even positions) in base 6 representation, we can write the expression as:\n\n$(2+d+d+5) - (d) = 11$\n\nSimplifying, we get $2d + 7 - d = 11$ which leads to $d = 4$. \n\nTherefore, for the base-6 digit $d$ to make $2dd5_6$ divisible by 11 in base 10, $d$ must be equal to 4.",
