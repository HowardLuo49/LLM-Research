    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Find the value of $x$ such that the four-digit number $\\underline{x15x}$ is divisible by 18.",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 18 is $3^2\\cdot2$, so in order for a number to be divisible by 18 it must be divisible by both 3 and 2. First, in order for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. In the case of $x15x$, this means that $x+1+5+x=2x+6$ must be divisible by 3. Since the constant term (6) is already a multiple of 3, $2x$ must be divisible by 3, which means that $x$ itself must be a multiple of $3$ as well. Second, in order for a number to be divisible by 2, the units digit must be an even number. In this case, the divisibility rule for 2 implies that $x$ must be an even number. Thus, since we know that it must be an even single-digit multiple of 3, the only possible value for $x$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$ such that the four-digit number $\\underline{x15x}$ is divisible by 18, we need to consider the conditions for divisibility by 18.\n\nA number is divisible by 18 if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. For a number to be divisible by 2, the last digit must be even. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.\n\nIn this case, the number $\\underline{x15x}$ must be divisible by 2, so $x$ must be even.

The sum of the digits in $\\underline{x15x}$ is $x+1+5+x=2x+6$. In order for this sum to be divisible by 9, we need to have $2x+6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$.\n\nThis simplifies to $2x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}$.
