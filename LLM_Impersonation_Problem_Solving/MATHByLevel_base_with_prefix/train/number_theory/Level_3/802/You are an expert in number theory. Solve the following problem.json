    "solution": "The prime factorization of $27000$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3.$ These three factors, $2^3,$ $3^3,$ and $5^3$ are pairwise relatively prime, and this is the only possible triple of positive integers satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is \\[2^3+3^3+5^3=8+27+125=\\boxed{160}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the product of the three positive integers is $27000 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$.\n\nSince the three positive integers are pairwise relatively prime, they do not share any common factors other than 1. Therefore, each integer must be a power of either 2, 3, or 5.\n\nTo find the sum of the three integers, let's look at the prime factorization of $27000$:\n\n$27000 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$\n\nSince the three integers are pairwise relatively prime, we can distribute the prime factors among them.
