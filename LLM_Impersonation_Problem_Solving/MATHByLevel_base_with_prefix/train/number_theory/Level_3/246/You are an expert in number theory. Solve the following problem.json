    "solution": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal, we need to determine if the denominator 12 has any prime factors other than 2 and 5. Since 12 = 2^2 * 3, the only prime factor other than 2 and 5 is 3.\n\nFor $\\frac{n}{12}$ to result in a repeating decimal, the denominator must divide out all of its factors of 2 and 5. Since 3 is already present in the denominator, we need to find numbers between 1 and 11 that have only 2 and/or 5 as prime factors.\n\nThe numbers that fit this criteria are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11. Therefore, there are 8 integers between 1 and 11 for which $\\frac{n}{12}$ results in a repeating decimal.",
