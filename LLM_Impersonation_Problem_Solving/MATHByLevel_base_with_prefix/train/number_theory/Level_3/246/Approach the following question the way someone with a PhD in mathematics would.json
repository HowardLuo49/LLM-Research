    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For how many integers $n$ between 1 and 11 (inclusive) is $\\frac{n}{12}$ a repeating decimal?",
    "solution": "Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. Therefore, $n/12$ terminates if and only if the numerator has a factor of $3$ in it to cancel out the $3$ in the denominator. Since $3$ integers from $1$ to $11$ are divisible by $3$, there are $11-3=\\boxed{8}$ integers $n$ for which the fraction is a repeating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for which integers $n$ between 1 and 11 the fraction $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal, we must consider the prime factorization of the denominator 12. The prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$, which means that when expressed as a decimal, $\\frac{n}{12}$ will terminate only if $n$ has a prime factorization that includes only 2's and 3's.\n\nSince the possible values for $n$ range from 1 to 11, we can examine each integer individually to see if its prime factorization consists only of 2's and 3's. We find that the following integers have prime factorizations that include only 2's and 3's: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. This gives us a total of 7 integers between 1 and 11 for which $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: there are 7 integers $n$ between 1 and 11 for which $\\frac{n}{12}$ is a repeating decimal.",
