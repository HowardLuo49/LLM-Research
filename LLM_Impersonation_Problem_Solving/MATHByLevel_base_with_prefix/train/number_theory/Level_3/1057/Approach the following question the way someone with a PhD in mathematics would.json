    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the perfect square as $m^2$ and the perfect cube as $k^3$, where $m$ and $k$ are positive integers. \n\nWe have:\n$2n = m^2$\n$3n = k^3$\n\nFrom the first equation, we can rewrite $n = \\frac{m^2}{2}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$3 \\cdot \\frac{m^2}{2} = k^3$\n$3m^2 = 2k^3$\n\nFrom this, we can see that $3m^2$ must be divisible by 2. Thus, $m^2$ must be divisible by 2, which means that $m$ must be an even number. Let's rewrite $m = 2p$, where $p$ is a positive integer.\n\nSubstitute $m = 2p$ into the equation:\n$3(2p)^2 = 2k^3$\n$12p^2 = 2k^3$\n$6p^2 = k^3$\n\nThis tells us that $k^3$ must be divisible by 6. Since $k^3$ is a cube, $k$ must be divisible by 6. Therefore, $k = 6q$, where $q$ is a positive integer.\n\nSubstitute $k = 6q$ into the equation:\n$6p^2 = (6q)^3$\n$6p^2 = 216q^3$\n$p^2 = 36q^3$\n$p = 6q$\n\nNow let $p = 6q$, so we have:\n$m = 2 \\cdot 6q = 12q$\n$n = \\frac{m^2}{2} = \\frac{(12q)^2}{2} = 72q^2$\n\nSo the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions is $72$.",
