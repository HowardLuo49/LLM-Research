    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $2n = k^2$ and $3n = m^3$, where $k$ and $m$ are positive integers. \n\nFrom $2n = k^2$, we have that $n = \\frac{k^2}{2}$.\n\nSubstitute this into $3n = m^3$ to get $\\frac{3k^2}{2} = m^3$.\n\nThis implies $3k^2 = 2m^3$, which means $3$ divides $m^3$. Therefore, $3$ divides $m$ and we can write $m = 3x$ for some positive integer $x$. Substituting this back into $3k^2 = 2m^3$, we have $3k^2 = 54x^3$, which simplifies to $k^2 = 18x^3$. This implies $k$ is a multiple of $3$.\n\nLet $k = 3y$. Substitute this into $k^2 = 18x^3$ to obtain $9y^2 = 18x^3$, which simplifies to $y^2 = 2x^3$. \n\nThis shows that $2$ divides $y$, so we can write $y = 2z$ for some positive integer $z$. Substituting this back into $y^2 = 2x^3$, we have $4z^2 = 2x^3$, which simplifies to $2z^2 = x^3$. \n\nTherefore, $x$ is also even, so we can write $x = 2w$ for some positive integer $w$. Substituting this back into $2z^2 = x^3$, we get $2z^2 = 8w^3$, which simplifies to $z^2 = 4w^3$. \n\nSince $4$ divides $z^2$, we can write $z = 4u$ for some positive integer $u$. Substituting this back into $z^2 = 4w^3$, we find $16u^2 = 4w^3$, which simplifies to $4u^2 = w^3$. \n\nThis implies that $2$ divides $w$, which contradicts our assumption that $w$ is a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integers $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube.",
