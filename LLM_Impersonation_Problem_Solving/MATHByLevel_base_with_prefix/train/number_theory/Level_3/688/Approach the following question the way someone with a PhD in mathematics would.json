    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A box contains gold coins. If the coins are equally divided among six people, four coins are left over. If the coins are equally divided among five people, three coins are left over. If the box holds the smallest number of coins that meets these two conditions, how many coins are left when equally divided among seven people?",
    "solution": "The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 6 are \\[4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, \\ldots.\\] The counting numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 are \\[3, 8, 13,\n18, 23, 28, 33, \\ldots.\\] So 28 is the smallest possible number of coins that meets both conditions. Because $4 \\times 7 = 28$, there are $\\boxed{0}$ coins left when they are divided among seven people. \\[ \\text{OR} \\] If there were two more coins in the box, the number of coins would be divisible by both 6 and 5. The smallest number that is divisible by 6 and 5 is 30, so the smallest possible number of coins in the box is 28, and our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can approach it algebraically. Let x be the total number of gold coins in the box. According to the information given, we can set up two equations:\n\n1) x \u2261 4 (mod 6)\n2) x \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n\nFrom the first equation, we know that x leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 6. This can be represented as x = 6a + 4, where a is an integer.\n\nSubstitute the expression for x into the second equation:\n6a + 4 \u2261 3 (mod 5)\n6a \u2261 -1 (mod 5)\n6a \u2261 4 (mod 5)\na \u2261 4 (mod 5)\n\nSo a can be written as a = 5b + 4, where b is an integer.\n\nNow substitute the expression for a back into x = 6a + 4:\nx = 6(5b + 4) + 4\nx = 30b + 28\n\nTo find the smallest number of coins that meets the conditions, we can start with b = 0 and increment it until we get a number that satisfies both equations.\n\nFor b = 0, x = 28 which satisfies both conditions. Now, divide 28 equally among 7 people:\n\n28 \u00f7 7 = 4\n\nTherefore, when the box containing the smallest number of coins is divided equally among seven people, there would be 4 coins left over.",
