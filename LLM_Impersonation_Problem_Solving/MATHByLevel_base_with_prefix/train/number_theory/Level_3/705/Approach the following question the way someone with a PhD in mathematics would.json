    "solution": "If $k$ is a positive even integer, then $$9^{k} = 81^{k/2}=\\overbrace{(81)(81)\\cdots (81)}^{k/2\\text{ times}},$$so $9^k$ has a units digit of 1. Since 8 is even, $8^7$ is even.  Therefore, $9^{8^7}$ has a units digit of $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $9^{8^7}$, we first need to consider the pattern of units digits of powers of 9. \n\nThe units digit of any power of 9 follows a repeating pattern: 9, 1, 9, 1, ... This is because $9^1$ has a units digit of 9, $9^2$ has a units digit of 1, $9^3$ has a units digit of 9, and so on.\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $8^7$ is divided by 2. Since any even number raised to a power is still even, the units digit of $8^7$ is always 8.\n\nUsing the pattern we identified earlier, the units digit of $9^{8^7}$ will be the same as the units digit of $9^8$, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $9^{8^7}$ is 1.",
