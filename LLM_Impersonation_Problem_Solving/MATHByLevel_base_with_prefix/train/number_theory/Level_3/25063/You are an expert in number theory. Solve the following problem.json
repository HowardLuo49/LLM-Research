    "solution": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n = 5^{23} + 7^{17}$. To find the smallest prime divisor of $n$, we first note that $n$ is an odd number since both $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are odd. \n\nWe can rewrite $n$ as:\n$$n = 5^{23} + 7^{17} = 5^{23} + (2^3)^{17} = 5^{23} + 2^{51}$$\n\nSince $2^{51}$ is even, $n$ is not divisible by $2$. \n\nNow let's consider $n$ modulo $3$:\n$$n \\equiv (-1)^{23} + 1^{17} \\equiv -1 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$$\n\nThis means that $3$ is a divisor of $n$.
