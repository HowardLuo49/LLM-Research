    "solution": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$, we can consider the expression modulo some small prime numbers. \n\nFirst, let's calculate $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ modulo 2. We know that any power of 5 will be odd and any power of 7 will be odd, so $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ will also be odd. Therefore, $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ is not divisible by 2.\n\nNext, let's calculate $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ modulo 3. We know that $5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. So, $5^{23} \\equiv 2^{23} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$ and $7^{17} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $5^{23} + 7^{17} \\equiv 2 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$ is 3.",
