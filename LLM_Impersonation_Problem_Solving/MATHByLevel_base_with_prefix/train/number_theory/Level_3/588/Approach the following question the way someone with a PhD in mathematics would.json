    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, let us determine the number of perfect squares from 1 to 150. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 150 is $12^2 = 144$, and the smallest is $1^2 = 1$. Thus, there are 12 perfect squares between 1 and 150.\n\nNext, let us determine the number of perfect cubes from 1 to 150. The largest perfect cube less than or equal to 150 is $5^3 = 125$, and the smallest is $1^3 = 1$. Thus, there are 5 perfect cubes between 1 and 150.\n\nNow, to find the numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes (i.e., sixth powers), we can find the number that are less than or equal to $150$ and to the power of $6$. The largest sixth power less than or equal to 150 is $2^6 = 64$, and the smallest is $1^6 = 1$. Thus, there are 2 sixth powers between 1 and 150.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes (or both) in the range of $1$ to $150$ is $12 + 5 - 2 = 15$.\n\nTherefore, the number of numbers from 1 to 150 that are not perfect squares or perfect cubes is $150 - 15 = 135$.",
