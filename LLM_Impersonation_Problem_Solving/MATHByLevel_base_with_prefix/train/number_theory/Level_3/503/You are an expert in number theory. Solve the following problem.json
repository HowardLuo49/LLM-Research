    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$, we need to determine a number that has exactly 12 factors and is divisible by both 12 and 15.\n\nFirst, we note that if $n$ is a number with prime factorization $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ are positive integers, then the total number of factors of $n$ is $(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)...(a_k + 1)$.\n\nSince we are given that $x$ has 12 factors, we can express 12 as a product of positive integers:\n$12 = 1 \\cdot 12 = 2 \\cdot 6 = 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$\n\nThis means the prime factorization of $x$ has the form $p_1^{a_1} \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot p_3^{a_3} \\cdot p_4^{a_4}$ where $a_1 = 0, 1$, $a_2 = 1, 5$, $a_3 = 1, 3$, $a_4 = 2$, and $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$ are distinct primes.\n\nGiven that 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, we can express 12 and 15 as $2^2 \\cdot 3$ and $3 \\cdot 5$ respectively.
