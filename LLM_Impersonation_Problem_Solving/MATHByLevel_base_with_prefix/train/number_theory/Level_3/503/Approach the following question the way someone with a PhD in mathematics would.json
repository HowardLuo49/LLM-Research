    "solution": "Since $12=2^2\\cdot3$ and $15=3\\cdot5$ are factors of $x$, $x$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of 12 and 15, which is $2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. Since $x$ has 12 factors and the LCM has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$ factors, $x=2^2\\cdot3\\cdot5=\\boxed{60}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the value of $x$ given that it has 12 positive factors with 12 and 15 as factors, we can use the fact that the number of positive factors of a positive integer $n$ can be found by first finding its prime factorization.\n\nSince 12 and 15 are factors of $x$, we can express $x$ as $x = 12 \\cdot 15 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nTo find the total number of factors of $x$ using its prime factorization, we add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization, then multiply these incremented exponents together.\n\nFor $x = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$, the number of factors of $x$ is given by $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$.\n\nThus, the value of $x$ is $(2^2)(3)(5) = 60$.",
