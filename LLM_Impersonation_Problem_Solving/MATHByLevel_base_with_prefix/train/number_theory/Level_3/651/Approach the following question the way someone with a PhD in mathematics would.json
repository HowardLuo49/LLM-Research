    "solution": "Since $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ and $ad \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{7}.$$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any prime number $p$ and integer $a$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ if $a$ is not divisible by $p$.\n\nSince $7$ is prime and $2$ is not divisible by $7$, we have $2^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nNow, we can rewrite $2^{19}$ as $(2^6)^3 \\times 2$, which is equivalent to $1^3 \\times 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $2^{19}$ is divided by $7$ is $2$.",
