It is one less than a multiple of 8, and it is three less than a multiple of 7. What is the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of?",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the greatest possible integer Jo could be thinking of. We know $n<100$ and $n=8k-1=7l-3$ for some positive integers $k$ and $l$. From this we see that $7l=8k+2=2(4k+1)$, so $7l$ is a multiple of 14. List some multiples of 14, in decreasing order: 112, 98, 84, 70, .... Since $n<100$, 112 is too large, but 98 works: $7k=98\\Rightarrow n=98-3=95=8(12)-1$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{95}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of linear congruences. Let the positive integer that Jo is thinking of be denoted by N.\n\nSince N is one less than a multiple of 8, we can express this as: N \u2261 -1 (mod 8)\nSimilarly, since N is three less than a multiple of 7, we can express this as: N \u2261 -3 (mod 7)\n\nWe can rewrite the first congruence as N \u2261 7 (mod 8) and keep the second congruence as N \u2261 -3 (mod 7).\n\nNow, we can find the smallest positive integer that satisfies these congruences by considering the Chinese Remainder Theorem. By solving the system of linear congruences, we find that the smallest positive integer that satisfies both congruences is 52.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible integer that Jo could be thinking of is 52.",
