    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.\n\nTherefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$. \\begin{align*}\n22n+15&<10000 \\\\\n22n&<9985 \\\\\nn&<\\frac{9985}{22} \\approx 453.85\n\\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \\cdot 453 +15 =\\boxed{9981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 mod 22, we need to find the largest integer in the range of 1000 to 9999 that leaves a remainder of 15 when divided by 22. \n\nLet's consider the integer N=22k+15, where k is an integer. To ensure that N is a 4-digit number, we need to find the largest possible value of k. Since N is a 4-digit number, we have 1000 \u2264 N \u2264 9999. \n\nSubstitute N=22k+15 into the inequality above:\n1000 \u2264 22k+15 \u2264 9999\nSubtract 15 from all parts of the inequality:\n985 \u2264 22k \u2264 9984\nDivide all parts by 22:\n44.77 \u2264 k \u2264 453.81\n\nSince k must be an integer, the largest possible integer value for k is 453. Therefore, the largest 4-digit integer congruent to 15 mod 22 is:\nN = 22(453) + 15 = 9975.",
