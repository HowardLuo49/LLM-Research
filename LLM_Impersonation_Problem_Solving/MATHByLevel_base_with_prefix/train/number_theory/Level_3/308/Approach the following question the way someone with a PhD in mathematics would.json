    "solution": "There are 7 days in a week.  Two days of the year fall on the same day of the week if and only if they are congruent modulo 7.  Notice that  \\[284\\equiv4\\pmod7\\] and  \\[25\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] Therefore the 284th day and the 25th day fall on the same day of the week.  Therefore the 284th day of the year falls on a $\\boxed{\\text{Saturday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week on which the 284th day of the year 2003 falls, we need to find the remainder when dividing 284 by 7. This is because there are 7 days in a week and the days of the week repeat in a cycle.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of full weeks between the 25th day (January 25) and the 284th day. The difference is 284 - 25 = 259 days. Since 259 is not a multiple of 7, there are 36 full weeks between January 25 and the 284th day.\n\nNow, we need to find the day of the week for the 284th day by adding the remainder of 259 divided by 7 to the day of the week on which January 25, 2003 falls. Given that January 25, 2003 falls on a Saturday, we see that there are 36 full weeks (252 days) between January 25 and the 284th day. The remainder when 259 is divided by 7 is 6. Therefore, if January 25 is a Saturday, then the 284th day falls on a Friday.",
