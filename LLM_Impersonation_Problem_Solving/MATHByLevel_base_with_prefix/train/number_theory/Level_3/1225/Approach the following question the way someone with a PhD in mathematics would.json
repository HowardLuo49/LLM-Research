    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25?",
    "solution": "Every multiple of 25 ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75.  Since we want the product of the digits to be a positive multiple of 25, the final two digits must be either 25 or 75.\n\nA nonzero product of digits is a multiple of 25 exactly when two or more of the digits is are equal to 5. If a number ends in 75 and the product of its digits is a multiple of 25, then replacing 75 by 25 in that number will also give a smaller number whose product of digits is a multiple of 25.  Therefore we are looking for a number whose final two digits are 25 and for which 5 is one of the other digits.\n\nSince 525 is the smallest such number, the answer must be $\\boxed{525}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let n be the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25. Therefore, we can express n as 25k, where k is an integer.\n\nThe product of the digits of n can be represented as (a)(b), where a and b are the digits of n. Since n is a multiple of 25, at least one of the digits must be a factor of 5.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let a be 5. Then the product of the digits of n is 5b. Since 5b is a multiple of 25, b must be a multiple of 5. Since we want the least positive multiple of 25, let b be 5.\n\nThus, the digits of n are 5 and 5, and n = 55. The product of the digits of 55 is 25, which is a multiple of 25. Therefore, the least positive multiple of 25 for which the product of its digits is also a positive multiple of 25 is 55.",
