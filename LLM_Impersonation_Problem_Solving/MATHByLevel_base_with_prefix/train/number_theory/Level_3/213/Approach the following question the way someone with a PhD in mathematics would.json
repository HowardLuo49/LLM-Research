    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for $a$ to be its own inverse modulo $n$. In other words, we are looking for an integer $a$ such that $a \\cdot a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$.\n\nThis implies that $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, which means $n$ divides $a^2 - 1$.

Since $n$ is prime to $a$ (as $a^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$), we can conclude that both $a - 1$ and $a + 1$ are multiples of $n$.
