    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the unknown number of hours as $x$. \n\nAccording to the problem, $x$ must satisfy the following condition:\n\\begin{align*}\nx &\\equiv x^2 \\pmod{12} \\\\\nx - x^2 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12} \\\\\nx(1-x) &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn order to identify the least whole number solution that is greater than 4 hours, we calculate the congruences mod 12 for each integer from 5 to 11 when substituted into the expression. We find that $x=9$ satisfies the given condition. Hence, the least whole number of hours that is greater than 4 hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours is $9$.",
