On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem mathematically, we need to express the relationship described in the problem in terms of mathematical equations. \n\nLet's denote the number of hours as $h$. According to the problem, the clock equivalents are such that $h \\equiv h^2 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nWe can rewrite this as $h^2 - h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nFactoring out a common factor of $h$, we get $h(h - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nTherefore, the solutions to this equation are $h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ or $h \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nSince we are looking for the least whole number of hours greater than $4$ hours, we check the possible values of $h$ where $h > 4$ and $h \\equiv 0 \\pmod{12}$ or $h \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$. \n\nThe smallest solution that meets these criteria is $h = 13$ hours, as $13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$.\n\nSo, the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent\" to its square number of hours is $13$ hours.",
