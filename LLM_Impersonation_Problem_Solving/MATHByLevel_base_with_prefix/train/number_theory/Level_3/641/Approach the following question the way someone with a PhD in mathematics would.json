    "solution": "Since $2^2 = 4$, we can convert directly to base 4 by pairing digits together starting from the right side of our base 2 integer:  \\begin{align*} 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\\\ 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\\\ 10_2 &= 2_4\n\\\\ 01_2 &= 1_4\n\\end{align*}  Putting the base 4 digits together, we get $1011001_2 = \\boxed{1121_4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert a number from base 2 to base 4, we need to first group the binary number into sets of two digits, starting from the rightmost digit. If there are any remaining digits at the leftmost side, we can pad them with zeroes to form complete sets of two digits.\n\nIn this case, the binary number $1011001_2$ can be split into the sets $10$, $11$, and $00$. Padding with a zero, the complete sets are $01$, $10$, $11$, and $00$.\n\nNext, we can convert each set of two binary digits into its equivalent in base 4. The mapping is as follows:\n- $00_2 = 0_4$\n- $01_2 = 1_4$\n- $10_2 = 2_4$\n- $11_2 = 3_4$\n\nTherefore, the base 4 equivalent of the binary number $1011001_2$ is $2310_4$.",
