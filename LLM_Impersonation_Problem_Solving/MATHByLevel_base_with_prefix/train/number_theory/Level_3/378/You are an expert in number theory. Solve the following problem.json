    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's first rewrite the expression $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ as $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$. For $1 + \\frac{18}{n}$ to be an integer, $\\frac{18}{n}$ must be an integer. This means that $n$ must be a factor of $18$.\n\nThe positive factors of $18$ are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9,$ and $18$. Therefore, the positive integer values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ an integer are $1, 2, 3, 6, 9,$ and $18$.\n\nThe sum of these values is $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 18 = \\boxed{39}$.",
