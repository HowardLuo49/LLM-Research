    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 1512: $1512=2^3\\cdot189=2^3\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$. The only two squares of primes that divide 1512 are $2^2=4$ and $3^2=9$. Therefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is $2^2\\cdot3^2=(2\\cdot3)^2=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest perfect square factor of 1512, we first need to factorize 1512 into its prime factors. \n\n1512 can be factorized as follows:\n\n1512 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 7\n\nNow, to find the largest perfect square factor, we need to take pairs of similar factors and find the product, which results in a perfect square.\n\nThe pairs of similar factors in the prime factorization of 1512 are: 2^2 = 4 and 3^2 = 9.\n\nMultiplying these pairs together, we get:\n4 * 9 = 36\n\nTherefore, the largest perfect square factor of 1512 is 36.",
