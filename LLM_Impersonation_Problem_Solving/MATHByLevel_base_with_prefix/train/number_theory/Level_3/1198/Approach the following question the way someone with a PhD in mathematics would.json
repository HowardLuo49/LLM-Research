    "solution": "Note that $656_7=6\\cdot7^2+5\\cdot7^1+6\\cdot7^0=335_{10}$. Therefore, $a=3$, $b=5$, and $\\frac{a\\cdot b}{15}=\\frac{3\\cdot5}{15}=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to convert the given number $656_7$ into base-10. Using the definition of base conversion, we have:\n\n$656_7 = (6 \\cdot 7^2) + (5 \\cdot 7^1) + (6 \\cdot 7^0)$\n$= 6 \\cdot 49 + 5 \\cdot 7 + 6 \\cdot 1$\n$= 294 + 35 + 6$\n$= 335$\n\nTherefore, $656_7 = 335_{10}$.

From this, we can infer that $a = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\nFinally, we need to find $\\frac{a \\cdot b}{15} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} = \\boxed{1}$.",
