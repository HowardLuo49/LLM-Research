    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we need to find the largest possible value of $a^b$ less than 399. \n\nLet's consider some values of $b$:\n- If $b=2$, then $a^b \\leq a^2 < 399$, which means $a^2 < 399$. The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2 = 361$, so $a=19$ and $b=2$ is a possible solution.\n- If $b=3$, then $a^b \\leq a^3 < 399$, which means $a^3 < 399$. The cube root of 399 is approximately 7.37, and since $a$ must be an integer, $a=7$ is the largest possible value. However, $7^3=343$, which is not less than 399. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $a$ and $b$ that satisfies $a^b < 399$ is $a=19$ and $b=2$. The sum of $a$ and $b$ is $19 + 2 = 21$. \n\nThus, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is 21.",
