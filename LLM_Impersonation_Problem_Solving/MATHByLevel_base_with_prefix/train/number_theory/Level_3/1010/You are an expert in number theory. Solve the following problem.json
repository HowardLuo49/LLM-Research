    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest possible value of $a^b$ less than 399, we need to consider different values of $b$. Since $b > 1$, the smallest possible value of $b$ is 2.\n\nWhen $b=2$, the largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2 = 361$. This means $a=19$ and $b=2$, and the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $19 + 2 = 21$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $a$ and $b$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
