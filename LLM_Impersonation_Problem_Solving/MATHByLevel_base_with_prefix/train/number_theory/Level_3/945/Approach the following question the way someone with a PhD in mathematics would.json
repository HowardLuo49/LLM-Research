    "solution": "Since $a$ has three factors, it is the square of a prime. The smallest such square is $a=2^2=4,$ so we look to find the smallest positive integer $b$ with $4$ factors. The smallest positive integers with four factors are 6 and 8, of which $\\boxed{8}$ is divisible by 4. It is easy to check that no smaller value of $b$ would work for a different choice of $a$, because the next smallest square is 9, which is greater than 8.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least possible value of $b$, we first need to understand the properties of $a$ and $b$ given in the problem. \n\nSince $a$ has $3$ factors, we know that $a$ is a square of a prime number. This is because a number with $3$ factors can only be in the form $p^2$ where $p$ is a prime number. \n\nNext, we are given that $b$ has $a$ factors. Since $a$ is in the form $p^2$, we know that $b$ must have $p^2$ factors as well. A number with $p^2$ factors must be in the form $p^{(p-1)}$ for some prime number $p$. This is because the number of factors of a number in the form $p^k$ is $k+1$, where $k$ is a positive integer. \n\nNow, we are told that $b$ is divisible by $a$. That means $b$ must be a multiple of $a = p^2$. Thus, the least possible value of $b$ would be $b = p^2$. \n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $b$ is $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number.",
