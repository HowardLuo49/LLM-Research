    "solution": "The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$.  An integer is a divisor of $180$ if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in the prime factorization of 180.  An integer is a perfect square if and only if every exponent in its prime factorization is even.  Therefore, to form the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 180, we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 2 and we may take either 0 or 2 as the exponent of 3.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ perfect square divisors of 180: $2^0\\cdot3^0$, $2^0\\cdot3^2$, $2^2\\cdot3^0$, and $2^2\\cdot3^2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of perfect squares that are factors of 180, we first need to express 180 as a product of its prime factors. \n\nThe prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. \n\nTo be a perfect square factor of 180, a number must have each of its prime factors raised to an even power. This means that the exponent of each prime factor in the factorization must be a multiple of 2. \n\nFor the factor to be a perfect square factor of 180, we have the following possibilities for each prime factor:\n\n- For the prime factor 2, we can have powers 0, 2 (2^0 = 1, 2^2 = 4).\n- For the prime factor 3, we can have powers 0, 2 (3^0 = 1, 3^2 = 9).\n- For the prime factor 5, we can have powers 0 (5^0 = 1).\n\nTherefore, the number of perfect square factors of 180 is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor:\n\n2 choices for the prime factor 2 * 2 choices for the prime factor 3 * 1 choice for the prime factor 5 = 4 \n\nTherefore, there are 4 perfect squares that are factors of 180.",
