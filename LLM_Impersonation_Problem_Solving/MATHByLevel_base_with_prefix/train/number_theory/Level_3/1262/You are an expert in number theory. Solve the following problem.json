    "solution": "The expression $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ can be simplified as $\\frac{n}{n}+\\frac{6}{n}$, or $1+\\frac{6}{n}$. So in order for this expression to have an integral value, 6 must be divisible by $n$. Therefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ is just the sum of all the divisors of $6$. Since the prime factorization of 6 is $2\\cdot3$, we know that 6 is only divisible by 1, 2, 3, 6, and the final answer is $1+2+3+6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $\\frac{n+6}{n} = k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Rearranging the equation, we get $n+6 = kn$. This simplifies to $n(k-1) = 6$.\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, we know that $k>1$, so $k-1$ is positive as well. We now need to find all the pairs of positive factors of 6 such that the first factor is less than the second one. These pairs are $(1,6)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,2,3,6)$. \n\nFor each possible value of $k$, we find the corresponding value of $n$ by rearranging our equation. \n\nIf $k=7$, then $n(7-1) = 6$ gives $n = 1$. \nIf $k=4$, then $n(4-1) = 6$ gives $n = 2$. \nIf $k=3$, then $n(3-1) = 6$ gives $n = 3$. \nIf $k=2$, then $n(2-1) = 6$ gives $n = 6$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integral values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n+6}{n}$ is an integer is $1+2+3+6 = \\boxed{12}$.",
