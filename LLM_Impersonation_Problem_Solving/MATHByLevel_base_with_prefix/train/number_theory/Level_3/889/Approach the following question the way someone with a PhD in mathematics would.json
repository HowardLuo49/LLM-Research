    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$, we first need to evaluate the sum mod $5$ without explicitly calculating the sum.\n\nWe notice that each number in the sequence corresponds to one of the possible residues modulo $5$: $0, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4$. We know that the sum of the residues $0+1+2+3+4$ is congruent to $10$ mod $5$, which simplifies to $0$ mod $5$. \n\nTherefore, every subsequent sum of numbers modulo $5$ will also be congruent to $0$ mod $5. Since there are $124$ numbers in the sequence, the sum will be congruent to $0$ mod $5$ after the final number $123$ is added.\n\nTherefore, the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$ is $0$.",
