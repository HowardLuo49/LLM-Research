    "solution": "Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.\n\nEach group of $5$ numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+0=10$. Since $10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, we can ignore every group of $5$.\n\nThis leaves the numbers $121,122,$ and $123$. The sum of the residues is $1+2+3 \\equiv 6 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of numbers from $1$ to $123$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$\n\nwhere $S$ is the sum of the series, $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term.\n\nIn this case, $n = 123$, $a = 1$, and $l = 123$, so\n\n$S = \\frac{123}{2}(1 + 123) = \\frac{123}{2} \\cdot 124 = 123 \\cdot 62 = 7626$\n\nNow, to find the modulo $5$ remainder of this sum, we divide $7626$ by $5$:\n\n$7626 \\div 5 = 1525$ with a remainder of $1$\n\nTherefore, the modulo $5$ remainder of the sum $1+2+3+4+5+ \\ldots + 120+121+122+123$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
