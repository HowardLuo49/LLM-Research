    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest base-4 number with four digits, we consider the largest possible digit in base 4, which is 3 (since base-4 uses digits 0, 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, the largest four-digit number in base 4 can be represented as 3333.\n\nTo convert this base-4 number to base 10, we multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 4 and then sum the results:\n\n3*(4^3) + 3*(4^2) + 3*(4^1) + 3*(4^0) = 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 = 255\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number with four digits is 3333 in base 4, which is equal to 255 in base 10.",
