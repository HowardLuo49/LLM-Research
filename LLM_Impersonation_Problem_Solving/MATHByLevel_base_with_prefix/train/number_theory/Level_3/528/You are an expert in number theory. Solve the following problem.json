    "solution": "The largest base-4 number that has four digits is $3333_4$, which is equal to $3 \\cdot 4^3 + 3 \\cdot 4^2 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 = \\boxed{255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest base-4 number with four digits, we need to consider the maximum value that can be represented in each digit position in base-4:\n\n- The leftmost digit (most significant digit) can hold values from 0 to 3, so it can be 3.\n- The next digit can also hold values from 0 to 3, so it can be 3.\n- The next digit can also hold values from 0 to 3, so it can be 3.\n- The rightmost digit (least significant digit) can hold values from 0 to 3, so it can be 3.\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number with four digits is 3333 in base 4. \n\nTo convert this to base 10, we can use the formula:\n\n3*4^3 + 3*4^2 + 3*4^1 + 3*4^0 = 192 + 48 + 12 + 3 = 255\n\nTherefore, the largest base-4 number with four digits is equal to 255 in base 10.",
