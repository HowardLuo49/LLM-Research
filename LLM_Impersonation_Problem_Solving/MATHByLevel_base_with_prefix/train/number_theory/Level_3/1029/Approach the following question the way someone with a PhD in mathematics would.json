    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A band has 72 members who will all be marching during halftime. They need to march in rows with the same number of students per row. If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible row-lengths can the band be arranged?",
    "solution": "If $x$ members march in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=72=2^3\\cdot3^2$. Given that $5\\le x\\le20$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^3=8$, $2^2\\cdot3=12$, $2\\cdot3=6$, $2\\cdot3^2=18$ and $3^2=9$, for a total of $ \\boxed{5}$ row-lengths.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the possible row-lengths for the band to be arranged, we must first determine the factors of 72. As a mathematician, I will analyze the prime factorization of 72, which is 2^3 * 3^2. \n\nNext, we will consider all possible combinations of these prime factors to find the factors of 72. This can be done by considering all possible ways to distribute the prime factors among the rows.\n\nThe possible row-lengths can then be determined by calculating all divisors of 72 that fall within the range of 5 to 20. This can be done by listing out all the divisors of 72 and selecting only those that fall within the specified range. \n\nOnce we have found all divisors within the range, we can count them to determine the total number of possible row-lengths for the band to be arranged. By applying mathematical principles, we can analyze the problem systematically and arrive at a precise answer.",
