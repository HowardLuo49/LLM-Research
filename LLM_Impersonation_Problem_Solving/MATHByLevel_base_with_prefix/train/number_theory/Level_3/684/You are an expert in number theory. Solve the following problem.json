    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of jellybeans Alex buys as $x$. We know that $x \\geq 100$ and that $x$ leaves a remainder of $11$ when divided by $13$. \n\nTherefore, we can express $x$ as $13n + 11$ for some integer $n$. Since $x$ must be greater than or equal to $100$, we have:\n\n$13n + 11 \\geq 100 \\implies 13n \\geq 89 \\implies n \\geq \\frac{89}{13} \\implies n \\geq 6.846$\n\nSince $n$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $n$ is $7$. Therefore, Alex should buy:\n\n$x = 13 \\times 7 + 11 = 91 + 11 = \\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
