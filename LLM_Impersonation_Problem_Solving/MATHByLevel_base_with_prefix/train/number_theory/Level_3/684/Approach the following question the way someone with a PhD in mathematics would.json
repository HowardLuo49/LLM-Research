    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions. Let $x$ be the number of jellybeans Alex buys. We know that the total cost of the jellybeans is equivalent to the remainder after dividing them evenly among $13$ people, which is $11$. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n$x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$.\n\nWe also know that Alex wants to buy at least $100$ jellybeans, so we have the inequality:\n\n$x \\geq 100$.\n\nTo find the least amount of jellybeans Alex should buy, we need to find the smallest positive integer solution to the congruence $x \\equiv 11 \\pmod{13}$ that satisfies the inequality $x \\geq 100$. \n\nBy listing out multiples of $13$ and adding $11$ until we find a number greater than or equal to $100$, we find that the smallest solution is $115$. \n\nTherefore, Alex should buy $115$ jellybeans.",
