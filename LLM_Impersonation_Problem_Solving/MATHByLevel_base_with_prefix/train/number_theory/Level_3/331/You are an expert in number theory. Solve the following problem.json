    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. The seven digits in Sam's phone number and the four digits in his house number have the same sum.  The four digits in his house number are distinct, and his phone number is 271-3147.  What is the largest possible value of Sam's house number?",
    "solution": "First, we need to add up the digits in his phone number to see what the digits in his address add up to.  $2+7+1+3+1+4+7=25$.\n\nFor his address, we want to find the largest four-digit number whose digits add up to $25$.  Because we want a large number, the leftmost digit should be as large as possible, so the first digit should be $9$.  The next three digits, therefore, must add up to $25-9=16$.  Since the digits must be unique, the next digit cannot be $9$, so we will go for the next largest number, $8$.  The final two digits must add up to $16-8=8$, and since neither can be $8$, the next largest possibility for those numbers is $7$ and $1$.  Therefore, Sam's address is $\\boxed{9871}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four digits in Sam's house number be represented as $a,b,c,d$. We know that $a + b + c + d = 2 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 25$.\n\nSince the digits are distinct, the largest value for each digit is 9. We want to maximize the house number, so we should make the leftmost digit as large as possible. Therefore, let $a = 9$.\n\nNow we need to distribute the remaining sum of 16 among $b$, $c$, and $d$. Since we want to maximize the house number, we should make the rightmost digit as large as possible. Thus, let $d = 8$.\n\nNow, we have $b + c = 25 - 9 - 8 = 8$. The largest possible pair of distinct digits that sum to 8 are 4 and 5. Therefore, let $b = 5$ and $c = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of Sam's house number is $9543$.",
