    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we can first find the pattern of ones digits when powers of 7 are raised to increasing exponents:\n\n$7^1 = 7$ (ones digit is 7)\n\n$7^2 = 49$ (ones digit is 9)\n\n$7^3 = 343$ (ones digit is 3)\n\n$7^4 = 2401$ (ones digit is 1)\n\n$7^5 = 16807$ (ones digit is 7)\n\nAfter finding this pattern, we can see that the ones digit of $7^{35}$ will be the same as the ones digit of $7^3$ since the pattern repeats every 4 powers. Thus, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is 3.",
