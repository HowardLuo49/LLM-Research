    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of ones digits of $7^n$, starting with $n=1$ : $7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, 3, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of ones digits of $7^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 7, 9, 3, 1. Thus, to find the ones digit of $7^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the ones digit 7, $R=2$ corresponds to the ones digit 9, etc.) Since $35\\div4=8R3$, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we can look for a pattern in the ones digits of powers of 7. \n\nWhen we calculate the powers of 7, we find the following pattern for the ones digit:\n$7^1 = 7$ (ones digit is 7)\n$7^2 = 49$ (ones digit is 9)\n$7^3 = 343$ (ones digit is 3)\n$7^4 = 2401$ (ones digit is 1)\n$7^5 = 16807$ (ones digit is 7)\n$7^6 = 117649$ (ones digit is 9)\nAnd so on...\n\nWe notice that the pattern repeats after every 4 powers of 7. Therefore, to find the ones digit of $7^{35}$, we can look at the remainder when 35 is divided by 4. \n35 \u00f7 4 = 8 with a remainder of 3\n\nSince the pattern of ones digits repeats after every 4 powers of 7, we can conclude that the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is the same as the ones digit of $7^3$. From the pattern above, we see that $7^3 = 343$, so the ones digit of $7^{35}$ is 3. \n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $7^{35}$ when written as an integer is 3.",
