    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $10,\\!000$ divided by 15 yields a quotient of 666 with a remainder of 10. Thus $10,\\!005$ is a multiple of 15, and $\\boxed{10,\\!010}$ is the least five-digit integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15). For confirmation, note that $10,\\!010-15=9,\\!995$ is the next-highest integer which is congruent to 5 (mod 15).",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least five-digit positive integer that is congruent to 5 (mod 15), we first need to understand what it means for a number to be congruent to another number mod 15. \n\nTwo numbers are congruent mod 15 if their difference is a multiple of 15. In this case, we are looking for a five-digit positive integer that, when divided by 15, leaves a remainder of 5. \n\nLet's denote the five-digit positive integer we are looking for as x. We want to find the smallest value of x that satisfies the congruence x \u2261 5 (mod 15). \n\nSince x \u2261 5 (mod 15), we can express x as x = 15n + 5, where n is an integer. \n\nTo find the smallest possible value of x, we can start by setting n = 1. This gives us x = 15(1) + 5 = 20. However, 20 is not a five-digit number. \n\nWe can then set n = 667 to get the smallest five-digit positive integer that satisfies x \u2261 5 (mod 15) as x = 15(667) + 5 = 10005. \n\nTherefore, the smallest five-digit positive integer that is congruent to 5 (mod 15) is 10005.",
