    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. There is a prime number which is a factor of every sum of three  consecutive integers. What is the number?",
    "solution": "Let $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$ be three consecutive integers. Their sum is $(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n$, which is always divisible by $\\boxed{3}$, but not necessarily by any other prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the three consecutive integers be represented as n, n+1, and n+2. The sum of these three integers is 3n + 3. Since the prime number is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers, it must also be a factor of 3n + 3 for any integer n.\n\nBy factoring out a 3, we get 3(n + 1). Since the prime number must be a factor of this expression for all integer values of n, it follows that the prime number must be a factor of 3. Therefore, the prime number which is a factor of every sum of three consecutive integers is 3.",
