    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. How many more digits does the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ have than the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$?",
    "solution": "In order to solve this problem, we must first find the number of digits when $987_{10}$ is converted to each base. Beginning with base-3, we have that $2187>987>729$ or $3^7>987>3^6$. So, we know that the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has 7 digits. Similarly with base-8, we have that $4096>987>512$ or $8^4>987>8^3$. So, the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has only 4 digits. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent has $7-4=\\boxed{3}$ more digits than the base-8 equivalent.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the base-$k$ representation of a number $n$, we use the property that the highest power of $k$ less than or equal to $n$ determines the number of digits in the base-$k$ representation.\n\nFor the number $987_{10}$:\n- The highest power of $3$ less than or equal to $987$ is $3^5 = 243$. So, the base-$3$ representation of $987_{10}$ will have at least $5$ digits.\n- The highest power of $8$ less than or equal to $987$ is $8^3 = 512$. So, the base-$8$ representation of $987_{10}$ will have at least $4$ digits.\n\nTherefore, the base-3 representation of $987_{10}$ has $5$ digits, while the base-8 representation of $987_{10}$ has $4$ digits. The base-3 representation has $5-4=\\boxed{1}$ more digit than the base-8 representation.",
