    "solution": "The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$. Because $(1\\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$. Since $314-216=98$, we know that the digit in the $6^2$ place is $2$ because $72=2\\cdot 6^2<98<3\\cdot 6^2=108$. We then note that $98-72=26$, which can be expressed as $(4\\cdot6^1)+ (2\\cdot 6^0)$. Therefore the digit in the $6^1$ places is $4$, and the digit in the $6^0$ place is $2$.\n\nWe now see that $314_{10}=\\boxed{1242_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $314_{10}$ to base 6, we need to find the highest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 314. In this case, $6^3 = 216$ is the largest power of 6 less than 314. \n\nSo, we start by dividing 314 by $6^3$ to find the first digit of the base 6 representation:\n$314 \\div 216 = 1$ with a remainder of 98. \n\nNext, we divide the remainder 98 by $6^2 = 36$ to find the next digit:\n$98 \\div 36 = 2$ with a remainder of 26.\n\nContinuing with the remaining 26, we divide by $6^1 = 6$ to find the next digit:\n$26 \\div 6 = 4$ with a remainder of 2.\n\nFinally, the last digit is just the remainder 2. Therefore, $314_{10}$ in base 6 is $1242_6$.",
