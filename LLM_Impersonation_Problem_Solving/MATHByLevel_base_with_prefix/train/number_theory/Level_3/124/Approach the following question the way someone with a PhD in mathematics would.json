    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "solution": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $3n = k^2$ and $2n = m^3$, where $k$ and $m$ are integers. \n\nFrom the first equation, we have $n = \\frac{k^2}{3}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $2\\left(\\frac{k^2}{3}\\right) = m^3$. This simplifies to $\\frac{2k^2}{3} = m^3$, or $2k^2 = 3m^3$. \n\nSince $2k^2$ is divisible by 2, $m^3$ must also be divisible by 2. Therefore, $m$ must be even, so let $m = 2l$, where $l$ is an integer. Substituting this back into the equation, we get $2k^2 = 3(8l^3)$, or $2k^2 = 24l^3$. \n\nDividing by 2, we have $k^2 = 12l^3$. Therefore, $k$ must be a multiple of $\\sqrt{12} = 2\\sqrt{3}$. Let $k = 2\\sqrt{3}n$, where $n$ is an integer. \n\nSubstitute this back into the equation $3n = k^2$, we get $3n = (2\\sqrt{3}n)^2$, or $3n = 12n^2$, or $n = \\frac{1}{4}$. Since $n$ must be a positive integer, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions is $\\boxed{1}$.",
