    "solution": "Since $a\\equiv b^{-1}\\pmod n$, \\[ab\\equiv b^{-1}b\\equiv \\boxed{1}\\pmod n.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$, we can express $ab$ as $a(b\\bmod n)$. Since $b$ is invertible modulo $n$, we have $b\\cdot b^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. This implies that $b(b^{-1} \\bmod n) \\equiv 1 \\pmod n$. Therefore, $b^{-1} \\bmod n$ is the multiplicative inverse of $b \\bmod n$, which is equal to $a$ according to the given condition $a\\equiv b^{-1} \\pmod n$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$ is the remainder when $a(b\\bmod n)$ is divided by $n$, which is $a$ itself since $b\\bmod n$ is $a$ according to the previous reasoning. Thus, the remainder when $ab$ is divided by $n$ is $a$.",
