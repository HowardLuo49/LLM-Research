    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$?",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$, we first recall that $\\frac{1}{13}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal: \n\n$\\frac{1}{13} = 0.\\overline{076923}$\n\nHere, the digits $0.076923$ repeat infinitely. To find the 43rd digit after the decimal point, we need to determine which digit in the repeating block corresponds to the 43rd position.\n\nThe repeating block $0.076923$ has a length of 6, and since $43 \\div 6 = 7$ with a remainder of 1, the 43rd digit will correspond to the 1st digit in the repeating block, which is 0.\n\nTherefore, the 43rd digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is 0.",
