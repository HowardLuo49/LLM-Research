    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$ is $0.\\overline{076923}$. Since the first six digits repeat, we know that after every 6th digit the pattern will restart. Since $43\\div 6 = 7 r 1$, the first 42 digits will be seven repetitions of the same pattern followed by the first digit of the pattern. Since the first digit is $\\boxed{0}$, this is our final answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{13}$, we can perform long division. \n\n$1 \\div 13 = 0.076923$\n\nAs we can see, the decimals start repeating after the 6, so the 43rd digit after the decimal point will be the same as the 7th digit. Thus, the 43rd digit is 2.",
