    "solution": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$ where $0 \\le a \\le 3$, $0 \\le b \\le 2$ and $0 \\le c \\le 1$. In other words, there are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$ and 2 choices for $c$. So there are $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{24}$ natural-number factors of $N$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of natural-number factors of $N$, we consider the prime factorization of $N$. We have $N = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1$. \n\nAny factor of $N$ must be in the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, and $0 \\leq c \\leq 1$. \n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $N$ can be calculated as $(3+1) \\times (2+1) \\times (1+1) = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = \\boxed{24}$.",
