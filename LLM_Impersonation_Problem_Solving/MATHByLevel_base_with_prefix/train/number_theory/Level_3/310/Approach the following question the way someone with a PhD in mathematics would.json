    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the last digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$?",
    "solution": "Multiply numerator and denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ by $5^{10}$ to see that $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is equal to $\\frac{5^{10}}{10^{10}}$. This shows that the decimal representation of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is obtained by moving the decimal point ten places to the left in the decimal representation of $5^{10}$. Since $5^{10}$ has a units digit of 5 (as does every positive integer power of 5), we find that the last digit in the decimal expansion of $\\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the last digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$, we first need to simplify the fraction. We know that $2^{10} = 1024$, so $\\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1024}$. \n\nTo convert this fraction into a decimal, we divide 1 by 1024. Since we are only interested in the last digit of the decimal expansion, we can perform long division without worrying about the decimal representation beyond the desired digit.\n\nPerforming long division, we find that $1 \\div 1024 = 0.0009765625$. From this result, we can see that the last digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}} = 0.0009765625$ is 5. \n\nTherefore, the last digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{1}{2^{10}}$ is 5.",
