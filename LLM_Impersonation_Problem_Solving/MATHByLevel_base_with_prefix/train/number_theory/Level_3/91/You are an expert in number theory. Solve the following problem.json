    "solution": "Since the remainder is 6, $k^2$ must be greater than 6. We look at the perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49. The only one that leaves a remainder of 6 when 60 is divided by the perfect square is 9, so $k=3$. We know that 99 is a multiple of 3, so 100 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe can write the equation $ak^2+6=60$, where $a$ is a positive integer, since 60 has a remainder of 6 when divided by $k^2$. That means $ak^2=54$. When we find the prime factorization of 54, we get $2\\cdot 3^3$, which means $k^2$ must be $3^2$ and $k=3$. The remainder when 100 is divided by 3 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the positive integer $k$ as $n$. \n\nAccording to the given information, when 60 is divided by $n^2$, the remainder is 6. This can be expressed as:\n\n$60 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{n^2}$\n\nThis means that $60 = qn^2 + 6$ for some integer $q$. \n\nFrom this equation, we can see that $60$ is $6$ more than a multiple of $n^2$. \n\nNow, let's find a general expression for $qn^2$:\n\n$qn^2 = 60 - 6$\n\n$qn^2 = 54$\n\n$q = \\frac{54}{n^2}$\n\nSince $q$ is an integer, $n$ must be a factor of $54$.
