    "solution": "We see that the largest power of 5 that is less than 1357 is $5^4=625$, and the largest multiple of 625 less than 1357 is 1250, or $2\\cdot625$. From here, we find that the largest power of five less than $1357-1250=107$ is $5^2=25$, and the largest multiple of 25 less than 107 is 100, or $4\\cdot25$. Next, the largest power of five that is less than $107-100=7$ is $5^1=5$, simply giving us 5 or $1\\cdot 5$ as the largest multiple of 5. Finally, this leaves us with $7-5=2$, or $2\\cdot1=2\\cdot5^0$. Therefore, we can express 1357 as $2\\cdot5^4+0\\cdot5^3+4\\cdot5^2+1\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0$, which gives us $\\boxed{20412_5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert the decimal number $1357_{10}$ to base 5, we must find the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to 1357. \n\nStarting with the highest power, $5^5 = 3125$, we see that $1357 - 3125 = -1768$. Next, we move to the next highest power of 5, $5^4 = 625$. Dividing -1768 by 625, we get a quotient of -2 with a remainder of 518. \n\nMoving on to the next highest power of 5, $5^3 = 125$, we find that 518 divided by 125 gives a quotient of 4 with a remainder of 18. \n\nContinuing with $5^2 = 25$, we see that 18 divided by 25 gives a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 18. \n\nFinally, dividing 18 by $5^1 = 5$, we get a quotient of 3 with no remainder.\n\nPutting all these quotients together from highest to lowest power of 5, we obtain $1357_{10} = 4303_{5}$. Hence, $1357$ in base 5 is represented as $4303$.",
