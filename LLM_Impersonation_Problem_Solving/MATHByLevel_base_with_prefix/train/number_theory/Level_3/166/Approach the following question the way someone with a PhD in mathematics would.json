    "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let $k$ be the smallest integer satisfying the given conditions. We can express $k$ as $k = 17n + 1 = 6m + 1 = 2p + 1$ for some integers $n, m, p$. This can be rearranged to $17n = 6m = 2p$.\n\nNow, we observe that $k-1$ is divisible by both $17,$ $6,$ and $2$. Therefore, we can write $k-1 = 102a = 6b = 2c$ for some integers $a, b, c$.\n\nSince $6b = 102a$, we have $b = 17a$. Hence, $b = 17c$, where $c = 3a$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer $k$ satisfying the given conditions is $k = 102a + 1$, where $a$ is a positive integer. Thus, $k = 103$ is the smallest integer satisfying the conditions.",
