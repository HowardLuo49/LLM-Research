    "solution": "Note that 43 is a close to a multiple of 11, namely 44.  Multiplying both sides of the given congruence by 4, we get $44n \\equiv 28 \\pmod{43}$, which reduces to $n \\equiv \\boxed{28} \\pmod{43}$.",

We know that $11 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$, so the multiplicative inverse of 11 modulo 43 is 4.\n\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence by 4, we have:\n\n$n \\equiv 4 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 28 \\pmod{43}$.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the congruence $11n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{43}$ is $n \\equiv 28 \\pmod{43}$.",
