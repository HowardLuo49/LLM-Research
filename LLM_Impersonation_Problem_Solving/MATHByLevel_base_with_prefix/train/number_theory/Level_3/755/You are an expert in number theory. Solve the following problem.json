    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  What is the sum of those five prime numbers?",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the first prime number in the arithmetic sequence be p. Then the other four prime numbers in the sequence will be p+6, p+12, p+18, and p+24.\n\nSince all five numbers are prime, we know that p must be an odd prime number (since 2 is the only even prime number). Since p+6 is also prime, we can deduce that p must be less than 6, as otherwise p+6 would be divisible by 2. Therefore, the only possible value for p is 5.\n\nThus, the five prime numbers in the arithmetic sequence are 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29. The sum of these five prime numbers is 5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6 is 85.",
