    "solution": "Powers of 13 have the same units digit as the corresponding powers of 3; and $$\n3^1 = 3, \\quad 3^2 = 9, \\quad 3^3 = 27, \\quad 3^4 = 81, \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 3^5 = 243.\n$$Since the units digit of $3^1$ is the same as the units digit of $3^5$, units digits of powers of 3 cycle through $3, 9, 7,$ and $1$. Hence the units digit of $3^{2000}$ is $1$, so the units digit of $3^{2003}$ is $\\boxed{7}$. The same is true of the units digit of $13^{2003}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the units digit of $13^{2003}$, we can first look for a pattern in the units digits of powers of 13. We can calculate the units digits of $13^1,13^2,13^3,13^4,...$:\n\n$13^1 = 13$ (units digit is 3)\n$13^2 = 169$ (units digit is 9)\n$13^3 = 2197$ (units digit is 7)\n$13^4 = 28561$ (units digit is 1)\n$13^5 = 371293$ (units digit is 3)\n$13^6 = 4826809$ (units digit is 9)\n\nWe can see that the units digits of powers of 13 follow a pattern of 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, ... with a period of 4. Since 2003 is congruent to 3 modulo 4, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ will be the 3rd term in the pattern, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $13^{2003}$ is 7.",
