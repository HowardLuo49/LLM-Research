The given system of congruences is \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv 1\\equiv -1\\pmod 2,\\\\\na\\equiv 2\\equiv -1\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv 3\\equiv -1\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv 4\\equiv -1\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Note that if $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 4$, then $a\\equiv-1\\pmod 2$ as well,  so we need only consider the final three congruences. Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv -1\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 59\\pmod{60}$.\n\nSo $a$ has a lower bound of $59$, but $59$ also happens to satisfy all of the original congruences.
