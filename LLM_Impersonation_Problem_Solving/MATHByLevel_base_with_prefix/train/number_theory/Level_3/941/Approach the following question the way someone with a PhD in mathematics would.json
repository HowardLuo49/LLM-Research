    "solution": "$3^7+6^6 = 3^6\\cdot3+3^6\\cdot 2^6 = 3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6\\cdot 67.$ Thus the greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{67}$.",

Therefore, $3^7+6^6 = 3^7+2^6\\cdot 3^6 = 3^6(3+2^6)$. \n\nNow, we can further simplify the expression by factoring out $3^6$, yielding $3^6(3+2^6) = 3^6(3+64) = 3^6\\cdot 67$. \n\nThus, the greatest prime factor of $3^7+6^6$ is $67$, as $3^6$ is not a prime number.",
