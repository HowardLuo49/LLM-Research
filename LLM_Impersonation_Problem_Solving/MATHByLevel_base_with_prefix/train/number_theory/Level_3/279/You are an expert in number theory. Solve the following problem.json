    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Jenna collects stamps.  She puts the same number of stamps on each page and then inserts each page into one of her two stamp books.  One of her stamp books has a total of 840 stamps.  The other has 1008.  What is the largest number of stamps that Jenna could be putting on each page?",
    "solution": "The number of stamps Jenna puts on each page must divide the number of stamps she puts into each book, so the largest possible number of stamps she puts on each page is gcd$(840, 1008) = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of stamps Jenna puts on each page as \\( x \\).\n\nFor the first stamp book with 840 stamps, let's say she puts \\( n \\) stamps on each page and has \\( m \\) pages. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ n \\cdot m = 840 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second stamp book with 1008 stamps, let's say she puts \\( p \\) stamps on each page and has \\( q \\) pages. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ p \\cdot q = 1008 \\]\n\nGiven that Jenna puts the same number of stamps on each page in both books, we have \\( n = p = x \\).\n\nNow we need to find the largest number of stamps Jenna could be putting on each page. To maximize this value, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 840 and 1008 since Jenna can't put a fractional number of stamps on a page.\n\n\\[ \\text{gcd}(840, 1008) = 168 \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest number of stamps Jenna could be putting on each page is 168.",
