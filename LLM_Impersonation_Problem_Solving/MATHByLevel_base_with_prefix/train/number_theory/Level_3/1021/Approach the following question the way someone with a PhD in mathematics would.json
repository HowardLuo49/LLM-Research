    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number?",
    "solution": "An even number has a units digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, so the smallest digit not in that list of possible units digits is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number, we must consider the possible remainders when dividing any number by 2. \n\nWhen dividing a number by 2, the remainders can only be 0 or 1. Therefore, the units digit of an even number can only be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nAmong these possible digits, the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 5. This is because any number with 5 in the units place is odd, not even.\n\nTherefore, the smallest digit that is never found in the units place of an even number is 5.",
