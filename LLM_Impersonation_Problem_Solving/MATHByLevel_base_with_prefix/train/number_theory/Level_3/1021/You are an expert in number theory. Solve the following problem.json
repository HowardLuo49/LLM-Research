    "gpt_response": "The smallest digit that is never found in the unit place of an even number is 9.\n\nAn even number always ends in either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 9 is not included in this list, it is the smallest digit that is never found in the unit place of an even number.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 1?: The smallest digit that is never found in the unit place of an even number is 9.\n\nAn even number always ends in either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Since 9 is not included in this list, it is the smallest digit that is never found in the unit place of an even number.",
