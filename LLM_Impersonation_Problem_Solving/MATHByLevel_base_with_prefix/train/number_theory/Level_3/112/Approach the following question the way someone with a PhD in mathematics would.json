    "solution": "We know that both $72$ and $108$ are multiples of $n$, so $108-72=36$ is also a multiple of $n$. That is, $n$ is a divisor of $36$.\n\nNote that $24$ is not divisible by $3^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ is divisible by $3^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.\n\nSimilarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.\n\nThe only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself. Thus, $n=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of least common multiple (LCM) and how it is related to prime factorization.\n\nGiven that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, we can express these relationships using the prime factorization of the numbers involved.\n\nFirst, we know that $72=2^3\\cdot3^2$ and $108=2^2\\cdot3^3$. The LCM of two numbers is the least common multiple of their prime factorizations. Therefore, we can express the LCMs in terms of the prime factors:\n\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=2^3\\cdot3^2\\cdot a$ for some integer $a$.\n$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdot b$ for some integer $b$.\n\nSince the LCM of $24$ and $n$ is $72$, we know that $a=1$ and $n$ must contain the prime factors $2^3$ and $3^2$ but not $3^3$. This means that $n$ must be of the form $2^3\\cdot3^2\\cdot c$ for some integer $c$.\n\nSubstitute this expression for $n$ into the second LCM equation: $2^2\\cdot3^3\\cdot b=108$.
