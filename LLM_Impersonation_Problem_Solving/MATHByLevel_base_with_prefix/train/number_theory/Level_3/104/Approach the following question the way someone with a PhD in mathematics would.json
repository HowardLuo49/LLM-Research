    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the problem, we first need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$. \n\nSince $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$, we can rewrite this as $9x - 1 = 25k$ for some integer $k$. Thus, $9x = 25k + 1$. \n\nTo find the value of $x$, we need to consider the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$. The modular inverse of a number $a$ modulo $m$ is an integer $b$ such that $ab\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$. In other words, $b$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ in the ring of integers modulo $m$.\n\nSince we are working modulo $25$, we need to find the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$. The modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$ is $14$, because $9\\cdot 14\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$. \n\nTherefore, $x = 14\\cdot 1 = 14$ satisfies $9x\\equiv 1\\pmod{25}$. \n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$. \n\n$11 + x = 11 + 14 = 25$. \n\nSince $25$ is divisible by $25$, the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
