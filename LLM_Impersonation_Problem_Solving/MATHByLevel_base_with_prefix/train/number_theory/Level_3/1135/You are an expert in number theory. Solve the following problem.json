    "solution": "We are asked to find the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and subtract 5678 from it. The only palindrome in the 5600s is 5665, which is not greater than 5678.  The only palindrome in the 5700s is 5775, which is greater than 5678.  Therefore, 5775 is the smallest palindrome greater than 5678 and $x=5775-5678=\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive value of $x$ such that $x+5678$ results in a palindrome, we need to consider the properties of palindromic numbers.\n\nA number is a palindrome if it remains the same when its digits are reversed. In this case, the number $x+5678$ should be a palindrome.\n\nLet $x$ have $n$ digits. If $x$ is a palindrome, the first half of its digits must be the reverse of the second half. Since we want the smallest positive value of $x$, we should consider the case where the first half of the digits of $x$ are as small as possible.\n\nIf $x$ is a palindrome, then $x + 5678$ should also be a palindrome. Let's denote the resulting palindrome as $p$. The palindrome must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. $p + p = 10^n + 1$ (since $x$ and $x + 5678$ have the same number of digits)\n2. $p > 5678$ (since $x$ must be positive)\n\nBy considering these conditions, we can find that the smallest positive value of $x$ for which $x + 5678$ results in a palindrome is $x = 3223$.",
