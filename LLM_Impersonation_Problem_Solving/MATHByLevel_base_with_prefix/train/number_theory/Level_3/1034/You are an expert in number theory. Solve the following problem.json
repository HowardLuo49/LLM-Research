    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. How many different positive values of $x$ will make this statement true: there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$.",
    "solution": "If there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$, those two multiples must be $x$ and $2x$.  Therefore, $2x$ must be less than $100$, while $3x$ the next largest multiple of $x$, must be at least $100$ (or else there would be $3$, not $2$ multiples in the two-digit range).\n\nIt may take some trial and error to find the smallest and largest possible values of $x$ under these conditions.  The smallest is $x=34$, because $3x=102$, the smallest three-digit multiple of $3$.  If we tried anything smaller than $34$, $x$, $2x$, and $3x$ would all have two digits, and that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nThe largest possible value of $x$ is $49$, because if $x$ were $50$, $2x$ would equal $100$, and only one multiple of $x$ would have two digits.  Every value of $x$ from $34$ to $49$ works.\n\nNow, we must count the number of integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.  This is a surprisingly tricky process: you might think there should be $49-34$, or $15$ possible values of $x$, but that's not actually right!  Suppose we subtract $33$ from each number.  Then we are counting the numbers from $1$ to $16,$ and so there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers from $34$ to $49,$ inclusive.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the positive two-digit multiples of $x$ be $xm$ and $xn$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers greater than $1$ and less than $10$. \n\nSince $xm$ and $xn$ are both two-digit numbers, we have $10 \\leq xm, xn < 100$, which implies $1 \\leq m, n < 10$. \n\nWe need to count the number of positive integers $x$ such that there are exactly $2$ positive two-digit multiples of $x$. This means we need to count the number of positive integer factors of $20$ (since $xm$ and $xn$ both have to be two-digit numbers).\n\nThe positive factors of $20$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$. Among these, $1$ and $20$ will not result in distinct two-digit multiples of $x$, so we need to exclude them.\n\nTherefore, there are $4$ positive values of $x$ that will make the statement true: $\\boxed{2, 4, 5, 10}$.",
