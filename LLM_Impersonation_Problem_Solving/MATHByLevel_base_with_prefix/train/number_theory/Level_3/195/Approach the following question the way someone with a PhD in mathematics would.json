    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many more digits 1200 has than 200 when expressed in base 2, we first need to convert both numbers to their binary representation.\n\n200 in base 10 is 11001000 in base 2.\n1200 in base 10 is 10010110000 in base 2.\n\nTo compare the number of digits in each binary representation, we count the number of digits in each binary number.\n\n200 has 8 digits in its binary representation.\n1200 has 11 digits in its binary representation.\n\nTherefore, 1200 has 3 more digits than 200 when expressed in base 2.",
