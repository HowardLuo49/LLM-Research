    "solution": "We are looking at powers of 2, so we notice that $2^3=8=7+1$.  Therefore  \\[2^3\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] In particular \\[2^{87}\\equiv2^{3\\cdot29}\\equiv 8^{29}\\equiv 1^{29}\\equiv1\\pmod7.\\] Therefore \\[2^{87}+3\\equiv1+3\\equiv4\\pmod7.\\] The remainder upon division by 7 is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by $7$, we can first consider the pattern of powers of $2$ modulo $7$. We observe that $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$, $2^4 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, and so on. This pattern repeats every $3$ powers.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite $2^{87}$ as $2^{3(29)+0} = (2^3)^{29} \\cdot 2^{0} \\equiv 1^{29} \\cdot 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, adding $3$ to $2^{87}$ gives $2^{87} + 3 \\equiv 1 + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nHence, the remainder when $2^{87} + 3$ is divided by $7$ is $4$.",
