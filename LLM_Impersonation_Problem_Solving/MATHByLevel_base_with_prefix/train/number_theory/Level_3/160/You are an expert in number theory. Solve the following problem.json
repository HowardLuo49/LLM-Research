    "solution": "Let's find the cycle of units digits of $3^n$, starting with $n=1$ (note that the tens digit 2 in 23 has no effect on the units digit): $3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1,\\ldots$ . The cycle of units digits of $23^{n}$ is 4 digits long: 3, 9, 7, 1. Thus, to find the units digit of $23^n$ for any positive $n$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 4 ($R=1$ corresponds to the units digit 3, $R=2$ corresponds to the units digit 9, etc.) Since $23\\div4=5R3$, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $23^{23}$, we can use the concept of cycles.\n\nThe units digit of a number depends only on its units digit. In particular, the units digit of $23^n$ repeats in cycles of length 4. \n\nStarting from $23^1$, the units digits cycle through 3, 9, 7, and 1. Since $23^{23}$ is an odd power, it will end on the third number in the cycle, which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of $23^{23}$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
