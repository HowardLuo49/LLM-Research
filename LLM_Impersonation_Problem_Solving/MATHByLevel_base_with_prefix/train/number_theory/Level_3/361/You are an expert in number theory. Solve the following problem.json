    "solution": "The prime factorization of 135 is $3^3 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{7020}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 135 and 468, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number. \n\nThe prime factorization of 135 is 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 = 3^3 x 5. \nThe prime factorization of 468 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 13 = 2^2 x 3^3 x 13. \n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either prime factorization. So, the LCM of 135 and 468 is:\n\n2^2 x 3^3 x 5 x 13 = 4 x 27 x 5 x 13 = 7020. \n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is 7020.",
