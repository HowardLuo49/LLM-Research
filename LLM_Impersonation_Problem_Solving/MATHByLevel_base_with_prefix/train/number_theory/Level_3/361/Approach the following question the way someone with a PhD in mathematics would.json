    "solution": "The prime factorization of 135 is $3^3 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{7020}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 135 and 468, we first need to find the prime factorization of each number.\n\n135 = 3*3*3*5 = 3^3 * 5\n468 = 2*2*3*3*13 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 13\n\nNext, we identify all the unique prime factors in the prime factorization of each number. In this case, the unique prime factors are 2, 3, 5, and 13.\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number's factorization. So the LCM of 135 and 468 is:\n\n2^2 * 3^3 * 5 * 13 = 7020\n\nTherefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is 7020.",
