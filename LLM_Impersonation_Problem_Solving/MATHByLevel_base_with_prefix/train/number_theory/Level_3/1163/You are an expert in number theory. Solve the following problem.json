    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$, we can first find the ones digit of $22^{11}$, then find the ones digit of $22^{(11^{11})}$, and finally find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$.\n\nFirst, we find the ones digit of $22^{11}$. We know that $22^2 = 484$, so the ones digit of $22^{11}$ is the same as the ones digit of $4^{11}$ since the ones digit of 22 is 4. In general, we know that the ones digit of $a^5$ is the same as the ones digit of $a$, so we can easily find the ones digit of $4^{11}$ by taking the ones digit of $4$. Since $4^1 = 4$, the ones digit of $4^{11}$ is 4.\n\nNext, we find the ones digit of $22^{(11^{11})}$. From the previous calculation, we know that the ones digit of $22^{11}$ is 4. Therefore, the ones digit of $22^{(11^{11})}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^{11}$ since the ones digit of 22 is 2. Since $2^4 = 16$ and $2^5 = 32$, the ones digit of $2^{11}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2$. Therefore, the ones digit of $22^{(11^{11})}$ is 2.\n\nFinally, we find the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$. We know that the ones digit of $22^{22}$ is 4, and the ones digit of $22^{(11^{11})}$ is 2. Therefore, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is the same as the ones digit of $4^2$, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
