    "solution": "First, observe that the units digit of $22^n$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^n$ for all positive integers $n$. Also, observe that the ones digits of $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots$ are 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, .... Since $22(11^{11})$ is even but not divisible by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, the units digit of $22^{22(11)^{11}}$ is the second digit in the repeating block 2, 4, 8, 6, which is $\\boxed{4}$.",

Since the ones digit of $22^{11}$ is 2, we need to find the remainder when $22(11^{11})$ is divided by 10. Since 22 is even, the ones digit of $22(11^{11})$ will be determined by the ones digit of $11^{11}$. \n\nThe powers of 11 have a simple pattern for the ones digit: 11, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

To find the ones digit of $22^{22}$, we need to consider the repeating pattern in the ones digits of the powers of 22. \n\nThe pattern for the ones digits of the powers of 22 is 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6. \n\nTherefore, the ones digit of $22^{22}$ is 6. \n\nIn conclusion, the ones digit of $22^{22(11^{11})}$ is 6.",
