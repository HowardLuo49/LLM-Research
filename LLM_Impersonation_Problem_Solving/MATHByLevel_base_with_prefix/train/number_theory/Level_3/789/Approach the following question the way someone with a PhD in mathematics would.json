    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\\overline{594}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block. We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$. Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $111$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{33}{555}$, we first simplify the fraction to $\\frac{1}{15}$, as both $33$ and $555$ are divisible by $33$. \n\nNow, we can express $\\frac{1}{15}$ as a decimal by performing long division. We have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r r}\n0.0 & 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 \\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n15) 1.0000000000000000 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nAs we can see, the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{15}$ is $0.06666666\\ldots$ where $6$ repeats. This means that the decimal representation is $\\frac{1}{15} = 0.\\overline{6}$. \n\nTo find the $111$th digit after the decimal point, we first notice that the decimal repeats every $1$ digit. Therefore, we can divide $111$ by $1$ to find the remainder. The remainder is $0$, and the $111$th digit after the decimal point will be the first digit in the repeating block, which is $6$. \n\nTherefore, the $111$th digit after the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{33}{555}$ is $\\boxed{6}$.",
