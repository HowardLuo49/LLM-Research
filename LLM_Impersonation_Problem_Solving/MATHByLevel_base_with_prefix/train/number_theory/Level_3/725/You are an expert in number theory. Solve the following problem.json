    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Josef and Timothy play a game in which Josef picks an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and Timothy divides 1000 by that integer and states whether or not the quotient is an integer.  How many integers could Josef pick such that Timothy's quotient is an integer?",
    "solution": "Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000.  Our goal is to count the positive divisors of $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We see that 1000 has $(3 + 1)(3+1) = 16$ positive divisors, hence there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers Josef could pick to make Timothy's number an integer.",
    "gpt_response": "For Timothy's quotient to be an integer, the integer that Josef picks must be a divisor of 1000. Therefore, the possible integers that Josef can pick are the divisors of 1000. \n\nTo find the number of divisors of 1000, we need to factorize 1000. \n\n1000 = 2^3 * 5^3\n\nThe number of divisors of 1000 can be found by multiplying the powers of each prime factor in the prime factorization of 1000 by one more than the corresponding power, and then multiplying these results together.\n\nFor 1000, the number of divisors is (3+1)*(3+1) = 16. \n\nTherefore, Josef can pick 16 different integers such that Timothy's quotient is an integer.",
