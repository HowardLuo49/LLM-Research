    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since we have $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we know that $3^{400}, 3^{800}, 3^{1200}, \\ldots$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. \n\nSo, $3^{12000}= (3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are 001.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 001?: Since we have $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$, we know that $3^{400}, 3^{800}, 3^{1200}, \\ldots$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 1000. \n\nSo, $3^{12000}= (3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nTherefore, the last three digits of $3^{12000}$ are 001.",
