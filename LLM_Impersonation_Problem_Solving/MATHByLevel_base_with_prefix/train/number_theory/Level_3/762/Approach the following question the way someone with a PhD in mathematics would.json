    "solution": "The units digit of $mn$ is $1^6 = 1$.  Searching for a units digit for $n$ (which is clearly odd), we find that $7 \\cdot 3 = 1$, so $\\boxed{3}$ is the units digit of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit of $n$, we need to analyze the units digit of $m$ and the properties of the units digit in multiplication.\n\nSince the units digit of $m$ is 7, we know that $m \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$. This means that $m$ ends in 7 when written in base 10.\n\nGiven that $mn = 21^6$, we can rewrite this as $n = \\frac{21^6}{m}$. Since $m$ ends in 7, we can simplify this further by noting that $n$ is equivalent to $\\frac{21^6}{7}$ in modulo 10 arithmetic. \n\nNow, we can look at the units digit of $21^6$ to determine the units digit of $n. We know that the units digit of $21$ is 1 raised to any power is always 1. Therefore, $n$ ends in the same digit as $\\frac{1}{7} = 3$.\n\nThus, the units digit of $n$ is 3.",
