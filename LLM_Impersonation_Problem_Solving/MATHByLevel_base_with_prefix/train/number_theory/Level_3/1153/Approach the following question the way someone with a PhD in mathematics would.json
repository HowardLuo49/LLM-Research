    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "Let x be the positive integer that we are looking for. We know that x is divisible by 18, so x = 18 * k for some positive integer k. \n\nWe are also given that the cube root of x is between 8 and 8.1, which means 8 < \u221bx < 8.1. Taking the cube of both sides, we get 512 < x < 592. \n\nSince x = 18k and 512 < x < 592, we have 512 < 18k < 592. Dividing by 18, we get 28.44 < k < 32.89. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for k are 29, 30, and 31. We can check these values to see which one satisfies all the conditions. \n\nIf k = 29, then x = 18 * 29 = 522, which is too small. \nIf k = 30, then x = 18 * 30 = 540, which is the answer as it satisfies all the conditions. \nIf k = 31, then x = 18 * 31 = 558, which is too large. \n\nTherefore, the positive integer that is divisible by 18 and whose cube root is between 8 and 8.1 is 540.",
