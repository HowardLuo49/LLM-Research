    "solution": "We want an integer $n$ such that $8 < \\sqrt[3]{n} < 8.1$. Cubing each part of the inequality gives $8^3 < n < 8.1^3$, or $512 < n < 531.441$. We know $n$ is a multiple of 18, so we try to find a multiple of 18 in this range (we can do this by letting $n = 18k$, and trying out different integer values of $k$). We find that $18 \\cdot 29 = 522$ is the only multiple of 18 in this range. So $\\boxed{522}$ is the answer.",

Let's denote the cube root of x as z. This means that 8 < z < 8.1.\n\nWe can write z as the cube root of x, or z = (x)^(1/3).
