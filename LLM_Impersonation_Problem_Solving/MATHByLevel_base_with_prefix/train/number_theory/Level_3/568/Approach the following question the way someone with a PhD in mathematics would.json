    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $4a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 21. One approach is to check integers of the form $21k+1$, where $k\\geq 0$ is an integer, for divisibility by 4. We find that 22 and 43 are not divisible by 4, but $21(3)+1=64$ is equal to $4\\times 16$. Thus $\\boxed{16}$ times 4 is congruent to 1 modulo 21.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $4x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{21}$. In other words, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $4x = 1 + 21k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nTo do this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm. We begin by finding the greatest common divisor of $4$ and $21$. By the Euclidean algorithm, we have:\n\n$21 = 5 \\times 4 + 1$\n\nNow, we can express this equation in terms of congruences:\n\n$1 \\equiv 21 - 5 \\times 4 \\pmod{21}$\n\nThis implies that the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $-5 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{21}$.\n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of $4$ modulo $21$ is $16$.",
