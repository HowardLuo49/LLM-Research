    "solution": "We will search for palindromic primes in the 100s. Since the hundreds digit is 1, the ones digit must also be 1. We can only vary the tens digit. Setting the tens digit equal to 1, we look at the number 111. This number is not prime (divisible by 3). Setting the tens digit equal to 2, we look at the number 121. This number is not prime (divisible by 11). Setting the tens digit equal to 3, we look at the number 131. This number is prime, so the second-smallest palindromic prime is $\\boxed{131}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us first define a palindromic prime as a prime number that reads the same forwards and backwards. In the case of three-digit numbers, this means that the hundreds digit is equal to the units digit.\n\nThe first palindromic prime is 101. To find the second-smallest one, we need to consider the next smallest palindromic number that is also a prime number. Since the hundreds digit must be the same as the units digit, we can only consider palindromic numbers of the form $ABA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits. \n\nThe smallest palindromic number in this form is 111, but it is not a prime number. The next smallest one is 121, which is also not a prime number. Continuing in this manner, we find that the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime is 131.\n\nTherefore, the second-smallest three-digit palindromic prime is 131.",
