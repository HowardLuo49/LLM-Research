    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$, we need to first convert $473_{10}$ into base $8$. \n\nTo convert $473_{10}$ into base $8$, we will perform repeated division by $8$ and recording the remainders until we reach $0$.\n\nStarting with $473$, we have:\n$473 \\div 8 = 59$ remainder $1$\n$59 \\div 8 = 7$ remainder $3$\n$7 \\div 8 = 0$ remainder $7$\n\nTherefore, $473_{10} = 731_8$.\n\nThe first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $7$.",
