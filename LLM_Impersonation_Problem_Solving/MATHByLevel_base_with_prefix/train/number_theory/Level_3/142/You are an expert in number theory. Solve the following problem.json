    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$, we can divide $473$ by $8$ repeatedly to find the digits of the base $8$ representation.\n\n$473 \\div 8 = 59$ with a remainder of $1$. This means that the last digit of the base $8$ representation is $1$.\n\n$59 \\div 8 = 7$ with a remainder of $3$. This means that the next digit of the base $8$ representation is $3$.\n\n$7 \\div 8 = 0$ with a remainder of $7$. This means that the first digit of the base $8$ representation is $7$.\n\nTherefore, the first digit of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$ is $7$.",
