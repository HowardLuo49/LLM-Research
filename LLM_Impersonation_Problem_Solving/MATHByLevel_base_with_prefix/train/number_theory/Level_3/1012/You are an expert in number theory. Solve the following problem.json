    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by examining the possible values for $A$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are both prime, they must be odd (since $2$ is the only even prime) and $A \\neq B$.\n\nWe can then express $A$ and $B$ as $A = 2n + 1$ and $B = 2m + 1$, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.\n\nNow, we can express $A-B$ and $A+B$ in terms of $n$ and $m$:\n$A-B = (2n+1) - (2m+1) = 2(n-m)$\n$A+B = (2n+1) + (2m+1) = 2(n+m+1)$\n\nSince $A-B$ and $A+B$ are primes, $n-m$ and $n+m+1$ can only be $1$. This gives us $n = 1$ and $m = 0$ as the only solution.\n\nTherefore, $A = 3$ and $B = 1$. The sum of these four primes will be $3 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 10$, which is divisible by $2$, $5$, and $10$. However, it is not divisible by $3$ or $7$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C) }$divisible by 5}$.\n\nNote: We also could have deduced that one of $A$ or $B$ must be $3$ since they are all primes, and that the other would have to be $1$ in order to have $A-B=2$ and $A+B=6$ be prime. However, going through the algebra makes it clear that $A=3$ and $B=1$.",
