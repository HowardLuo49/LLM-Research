    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $A,B,A-B,$ and $A+B$ be denoted as $p,q,r,$ and $s$ respectively, where $p,q,r,$ and $s$ are prime numbers. \n\nGiven $p$ and $s$ are both prime numbers, the sum $p+s$ will always be even as both $p$ and $s$ are odd and the sum of two odd integers is always even.\n\nNow let's examine the divisibility of $p+q+r+s$ by $3$. Since $p$ and $s$ are both prime, they are either of the form $3k+1$ or $3k+2$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $p+s$ will be of the form $6m+2$ or $6m+4$ for some integer $m$. Assuming $p+s$ is congruent to $2 \\pmod{3}$, this implies $q+r$ is congruent to $1 \\pmod{3}$, which means that $q+r$ could be $1+1=2 \\pmod{3}$ or $2+2=4 \\pmod{3}$. In either case, $q+r$ won't be divisible by $3$, making $p+q+r+s$ not divisible by $3$.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the divisibility by $5$. Since $p$ and $s$ are prime, they could be of the form $5k+1,5k+2,5k+3,5k+4$ for some integer $k$. If $p$ and $s$ are congruent to $1 \\pmod{5}$, then $q+r$ will be congruent to $2 \\pmod{5}$, which would mean $q+r$ could be $2+2=4 \\pmod{5}$, not divisible by $5$. The same logic applies if $p$ and $s$ are congruent to $2,3,$ or $4 \\pmod{5}$, making $p+q+r+s$ not divisible by $5$.\n\nThis concludes that the sum of the four primes $p+q+r+s$ is an even number, option $\\boxed{\\text{(A)}}$.",
