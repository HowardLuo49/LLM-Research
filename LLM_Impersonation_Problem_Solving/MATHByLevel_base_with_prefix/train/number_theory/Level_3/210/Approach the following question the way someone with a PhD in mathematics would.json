    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors, we must consider the prime factorization of the number. \n\nWe know that the number of factors of a positive integer $n$ can be determined by the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$. Specifically, if $n$ has a prime factorization of the form $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1, p_2,...,p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_1, a_2,...,a_k$ are positive integers, then the number of factors of $n$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)...(a_k+1)$. \n\nFor a number to have exactly $10$ factors, this means that the exponent in its prime factorization is of the form $p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}$, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are positive integers. In this case, the number of factors is $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)=10$. \n\nTherefore, we need to find two positive integers $a_1$ and $a_2$ such that $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)=10$. The possible pairs of $(a_1, a_2)$ that satisfy this condition are $(1,9)$ and $(3,3)$. \n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors can be determined by the prime factorization $2^1 \\times 3^9 = 19683$, or $2^3 \\times 3^3 = 216$. The least of these two numbers is $216$. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors is $216$.",
