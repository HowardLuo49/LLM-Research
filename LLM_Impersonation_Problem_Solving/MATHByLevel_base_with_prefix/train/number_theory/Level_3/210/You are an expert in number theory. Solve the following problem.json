    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To have exactly $10$ factors, the number must be in the form $p^9$ or $p^4 \\cdot q$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers.\n\nIf the number is of the form $p^9$, then the total number of factors is given by $(9+1)=10$, as each factor of a number in the form $p^n$ can be written as $p^k$ where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. Therefore, the smallest number of the form $p^9$ is $2^9=512$.\n\nIf the number is of the form $p^4 \\cdot q$, then the total number of factors is equal to $(4+1)(1+1)=10$. The smallest number of the form $p^4 \\cdot q$ is $2^4 \\cdot 3 = 48$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ positive factors is $\\boxed{48}$.",
