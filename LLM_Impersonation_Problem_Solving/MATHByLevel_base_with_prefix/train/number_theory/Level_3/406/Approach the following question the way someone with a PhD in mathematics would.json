    "solution": "Since a terminating decimal can be written in the form of $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, we want to rewrite our fraction with a denominator of $10^b=2^b\\cdot5^b$. \\[ \\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}\\cdot\\frac{2^{5}}{2^{5}}=\\frac{31\\cdot2^{5}}{10^{6}}=\\frac{992}{10^{6}}. \\]Because the denominator consists only of a $10^6$ term, there are a total of 6 digits to the right of the decimal point, the last three of which are $992$. Therefore, the decimal representation of $\\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}$ is $\\boxed{0.000992}$",
    "gpt_response": "To express $\\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6}$ as a terminating decimal, we first simplify the denominator: $2\\cdot5^6 = 2\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5\\cdot5 = 6250$. Now, we rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{31}{6250}$. To convert this fraction into a terminating decimal, we perform the division. \n\nBy long division, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|l}\n  0.00496 & . \\\\\n  \\hline\n  6.25 & 31.00 \\\\\n  -31 & -31 \\\\\n  \\hline\n   & 0.00 \\\\\n   & -3125 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   & 875 \\\\\n   & -6250 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   & 2500 \\\\\n   & -2500 \\\\\n   \\hline\n   & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{31}{2\\cdot5^6} = 0.00496$ as a terminating decimal.",
