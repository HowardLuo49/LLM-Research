    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. We know the following to be true:\n\n$\\bullet$ 1.  $Z$ and $K$ are integers with $500 < Z < 1000$ and $K > 1;$\n\n$\\bullet$ 2.  $Z$ = $K \\times K^2.$\n\nWhat is the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square?",
    "solution": "From the second fact, we know that $Z=K^3.$ $Z$ is a perfect square if $K^3$ is a perfect square, so $Z$ is the sixth power of some integer. Since $500<Z<1000,$ the only value of $Z$ that works is $Z=3^6=729.$ Thus, $K=\\sqrt[3]{729}=\\boxed{9}.$",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote $Z = K \\times K^2$ as follows: $Z = K^3.$\n\nTherefore, in order for $Z$ to be a perfect square, $K^3$ must be a perfect square. This means that $K^3$ must be the cube of an integer. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $K^3 = M^3,$ where $M$ is an integer.\n\nTaking the cube root of both sides, we have $K = M.$\n\nSince $500 < Z < 1000,$ we know that $500 < K^3 < 1000.$\n\nThe cube root of 500 is approximately 8.66, and the cube root of 1000 is approximately 10. Therefore, $8 < K < 10.$\n\nThe only integer value of $K$ that satisfies the given conditions is $K = 9.$\n\nTherefore, the value of $K$ for which $Z$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{9}.$",
