    "solution": "To find the decimal expression, we try to get a denominator of the form $2^a\\cdot5^a=10^a$, where $a$ is an integer.  $$\\frac{3^6}{6^4\\cdot625}=\\frac{3^6}{2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot5^4}=\\frac{3^2}{10^4}=9\\cdot10^{-4}=0.0009$$So there are $\\boxed{4}$ digits to the right of the decimal point.",
