    "solution": "The base 5 number $34x1_5$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 5^3 + 4 \\cdot 5^2 + x \\cdot 5 + 1 = 5x + 476$.  The base-5 digit $x$ must be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Among these values, only $x = \\boxed{4}$ makes $5x + 476$ divisible by 31.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the base 5 number into base 10 and then check if it is divisible by 31.\n\nThe base 5 number $34x1_5$ can be expressed as:\n$3*5^3 + 4*5^2 + x*5^1 + 1*5^0$.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$375 + 100 + 5x + 1$.\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n$476 + 5x$.\n\nTo check if this number is divisible by 31, we will find the remainder when dividing by 31:\n$(476 + 5x) \\mod 31$.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$17 + 5x \\mod 31$.\n\nFor this expression to be divisible by 31, the remainder must be 0.

By trying out different values for $x$, we find that when $x = 10$, we get:\n$17 + 5*10 = 67$ which is divisible by 31.\n\nTherefore, the digit $x$ is 10.",
