    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 200th term of the sequence formed by omitting perfect squares, we first need to determine how many perfect squares will be omitted before reaching the 200th term.\n\nSince the perfect squares are always in the form of n^2 where n is a positive integer, we can find the largest integer k such that k^2 is less than or equal to 200. In this case, k = 14 because 14^2 = 196 and 15^2 = 225. Therefore, there will be 14 perfect squares omitted before reaching the 200th term.\n\nTo find the 200th term, we need to account for the 14 omitted perfect squares. This means that the 200th term will actually be the 214th integer in the sequence of positive integers.\n\nThe formula for finding the nth term in the sequence of positive integers excluding perfect squares is n + floor(sqrt(n)). Therefore, the 200th term of the sequence is:\n\n200 + floor(sqrt(200)) = 200 + 14 = 214.\n\nSo, the 200th term of the sequence formed by omitting only the perfect squares is 214.",
