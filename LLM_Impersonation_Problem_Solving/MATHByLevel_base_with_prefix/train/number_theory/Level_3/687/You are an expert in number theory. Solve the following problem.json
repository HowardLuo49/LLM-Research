    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The sequence of positive integers formed by omitting only the perfect squares is given by: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, ...\n\nThis sequence can be generated by counting the positive integers and skipping over the perfect squares. The perfect squares are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...\n\nTo find the 200th term of this sequence, we need to find the largest perfect square less than 200. Since 14^2 = 196, the 14th perfect square is less than 200. This means that the first 14 terms are perfect squares, so we have skipped 14 numbers in the sequence.\n\nThe 200th number in the sequence will be 200 + 14 = 214.\n\nTherefore, the 200th term of the sequence is 214.",
