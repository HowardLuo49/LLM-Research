    "solution": "We begin by listing all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. We can now start listing products of factors from least to greatest and find the first item in the second list that is not in the first; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8... 8 is not a factor of 36, but is the product of 2 and 4. We can check that there are no smaller products of factors that do not divide 36: 5 and 7 are the only possibilities, and obviously neither of them can be products of factors of 36. $\\boxed{8}$ is thus the smallest such product.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let us write down all the factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Since $x$ and $y$ are distinct positive integers and are factors of 36, we can pair them up as follows: (1,36), (2,18), (3,12), (4,9), and (6,6).\n\nWe are given that $x\\cdot y$ is not a factor of 36. Therefore, we can eliminate the pair (6,6) since $6\\cdot6=36$ is a factor of 36. This leaves us with the pairs (1,36), (2,18), (3,12), and (4,9).\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$, we need to find the smallest product among these pairs. The smallest product is from the pair (2,18) which gives $2\\cdot18=36$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $x\\cdot y$ is 36.",
