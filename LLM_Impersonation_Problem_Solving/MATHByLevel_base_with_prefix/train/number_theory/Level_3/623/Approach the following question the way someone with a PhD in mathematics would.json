    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $x$, we first need to determine all the positive factors of $x$ and then sum them to equal 24. Given that one of the factors is 3, we can express $x$ as $x = 3 \\cdot y$, where $y$ is the product of all the other factors of $x$.\n\nLet's express the factors of $x$ as $1, 3, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, where $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are the remaining factors of $x$. Since the sum of all the factors of $x$ is 24, we have:\n\n$1 + 3 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 24$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n\n$4 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n = 24$\n\n$y = a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot a_n = 21$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is:\n\n$x = 3 \\cdot y = 3 \\cdot 21 = 63$\n\nTherefore, if one of the factors of integer $x$ is 3 and the sum of all the positive factors of $x$ is 24, then the value of $x$ is 63.",
