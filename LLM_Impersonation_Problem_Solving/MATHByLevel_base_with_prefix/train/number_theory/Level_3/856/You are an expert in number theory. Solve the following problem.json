    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of digits in the base-7 representation of a number, we use the fact that the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to the number gives us the number of digits.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 956. \n\n$7^1 = 7$\n\n$7^2 = 49$\n\n$7^3 = 343$\n\n$7^4 = 2401$\n\nSince $7^3 = 343$ is less than 956, but $7^4 = 2401$ is greater than 956, the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 956 is $7^3 = 343$.\n\nTo represent 956 in base-7, we need to express it as a sum of powers of 7.\n\n$956 = 2 \\times 7^3 + 4 \\times 7^2 + 0 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0$\n\nTherefore, the base-7 representation of 956 is $2045$.
