    "solution": "The largest power of 7 less than 956 is $7^3=343$. Therefore, $956$ written in base 7 has $3+1=\\boxed{4}$ digits.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of digits in the base-7 representation of $956$, we first need to find the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 956. This power of 7 will determine the number of digits in the base-7 representation.\n\nIn this case, we can start by finding the highest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 956. We have:\n\n$7^0 = 1$\n$7^1 = 7$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^3 = 343$\n$7^4 = 2401$\n\nSince $7^3 = 343$ is the highest power of 7 less than 956, we know that the base-7 representation of 956 will have at least 3 digits. \n\nNext, we need to find the remainder after dividing 956 by 7^3:\n\n$956 = 2 \\times 343 + 270$\n\nNow, we need to find how many digits are needed to represent 270 in base-7. To do this, we need to find the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 270:\n\n$7^0 = 1$\n$7^1 = 7$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^3 = 343$\n\nSince $7^2 = 49$ is the highest power of 7 less than 270, we know that the base-7 representation of 270 will have at least 2 digits. \n\nTherefore, the base-7 representation of 956 will have 3 digits for the quotient and 2 digits for the remainder. Hence, the total number of digits in the base-7 representation of 956 is 5.",
