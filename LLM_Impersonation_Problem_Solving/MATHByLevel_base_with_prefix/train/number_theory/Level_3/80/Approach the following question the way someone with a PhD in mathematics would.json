    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $\\textit{composite number}$ is a number that has two or more prime factors. The number 87 can be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers in many ways. What is the minimum positive difference between two such numbers?",
    "solution": "The minimum difference between two numbers whose sum is 87 is achieved when the numbers are as close as possible to $87\\div2=43.5$. These numbers are 43 and 44, but 43 is prime, so we consider the next pair, 42 and 45, both of which are composite. Thus, the minimum positive difference is $45-42=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum to 87, we first need to find all possible ways to express 87 as the sum of two composite numbers.\n\nSince 87 is an odd number, one of the composite numbers must be even. The only even composite number less than 87 is 4. Thus, the other composite number must be 83.\n\nTherefore, the minimum positive difference between two composite numbers that sum to 87 is 83 - 4 = 79.",
