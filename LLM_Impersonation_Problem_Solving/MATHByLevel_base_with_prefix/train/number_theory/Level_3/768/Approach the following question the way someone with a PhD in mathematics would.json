    "solution": "Let $n$ be any integer that has its square between 4000 and 7000. Then $63 < n < 84$, because $63^2 < 4000<64^2$ and $83^2< 7000<84^2$. Between 63 and 84, the only primes are 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find prime numbers with squares between 4000 and 7000, we must first determine the values of the squares that fall within this range. Taking the square root of each boundary gives us the following limits: sqrt(4000) \u2248 63.25 and sqrt(7000) \u2248 83.67.\n\nWe now need to check all prime numbers in the range [64, 83], inclusive, to see if their squares fall within the given range. The primes within this interval are: 67, 71, 73, 79, 83.\n\nCalculating the squares of these primes, we get: 67^2 = 4489, 71^2 = 5041, 73^2 = 5329, 79^2 = 6241, 83^2 = 6889.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 prime numbers whose squares fall between 4000 and 7000.",
