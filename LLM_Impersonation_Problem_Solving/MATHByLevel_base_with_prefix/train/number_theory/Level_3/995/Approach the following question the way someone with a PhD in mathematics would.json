    "solution": "The second condition tells us that the integer must be between $25^2 = 625$ and $(25.3)^2 \\approx 640$. The only multiple of 14 in this range is $\\boxed{630}.$  (One easy way to find a multiple of 14 is to find a number that is both a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 7.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find a positive integer that is divisible by 14 and has a square root between 25 and 25.3, we need to first note that the square root of a number is always positive. Thus, we are looking for a positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nLet n be the positive integer we are looking for. Since n is divisible by 14, we can write n = 14k, where k is a positive integer. \n\nWe also know that the square root of n lies between 25 and 25.3. This can be written as 25 < \u221an < 25.3.\n\nSquaring both sides of the inequality, we get 625 < n < 640.09.\n\nSince n = 14k, we have 625 < 14k < 640.09.\n\nDividing by 14, we get 44.64 < k < 45.72.\n\nSince k is a positive integer, the only possible value for k that satisfies this inequality is k = 45.\n\nTherefore, the positive integer n = 14 * 45 = 630 satisfies the given conditions.",
