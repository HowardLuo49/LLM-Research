    "solution": "The binary number $b_k b_{k - 1} \\dots b_2 b_1 b_0$ is equal to $2^k b_k + 2^{k - 1} b_{k - 1} + \\dots + 4b_2 + 2b_1 + b_0$, so when this number is divided by 4, the remainder is $2b_1 + b_0$.  Hence, when the number $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4, the remainder is $2 \\cdot 1 + 0 = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when a binary number is divided by 4, we can look at the last 2 digits of the binary number. In this case, the last 2 digits of $100101110010_2$ are $10_2$, which is equal to 2 in base 10.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $100101110010_2$ is divided by 4 is 2 in base 10.",
