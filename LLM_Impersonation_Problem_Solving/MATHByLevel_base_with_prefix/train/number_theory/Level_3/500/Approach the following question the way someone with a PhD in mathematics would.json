James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible. In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",

Similarly, Lindsay started with $129 + 266 = 395$ coins.\n\nSince a roll of quarters contains 40 quarters and a roll of dimes contains 50 dimes, we can calculate the number of complete rolls they can make:\n\nFor James:\n\nNumber of complete rolls of quarters = floor($242/40$) = 6\nNumber of complete rolls of dimes = floor($242/50$) = 4\n\nFor Lindsay:\n\nNumber of complete rolls of quarters = floor($395/40$) = 9\nNumber of complete rolls of dimes = floor($395/50$) = 7\n\nAfter making the complete rolls, James has 242 - 6*40 = 2 quarters and 242 - 4*50 = 42 dimes left over. Similarly, Lindsay has 395 - 9*40 = 35 quarters and 395 - 7*50 = 45 dimes left over.\n\nNow we can calculate the total value of the leftover quarters and dimes:\n\nValue of leftover quarters for James = $0.25*2 = $0.50\nValue of leftover dimes for James = $0.10*42 = $4.20\nTotal value of leftover coins for James = $0.50 + $4.20 = $4.70\n\nValue of leftover quarters for Lindsay = $0.25*35 = $8.75\nValue of leftover dimes for Lindsay = $0.10*45 = $4.50\nTotal value of leftover coins for Lindsay = $8.75 + $4.50 = $13.25\n\nTherefore, in total, the leftover quarters and dimes are worth $4.70 + $13.25 = $17.95.",
