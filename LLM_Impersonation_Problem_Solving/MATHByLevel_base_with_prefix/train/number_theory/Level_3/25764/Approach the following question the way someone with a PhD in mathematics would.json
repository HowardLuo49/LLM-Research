    "solution": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by 5, we first need to factorize $150$ into its prime factors. \n\n$150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$\n\nNow, for a positive integer $n$ represented by $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}...p_k^{e_k}$, the number of positive divisors of $n$ is given by $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)...(e_k+1)$. \n\nIn the case of $150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$, the number of positive divisors (including 1 and $150$) is $(1+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 12$. \n\nNow we need to find the number of positive divisors that are not divisible by 5.
