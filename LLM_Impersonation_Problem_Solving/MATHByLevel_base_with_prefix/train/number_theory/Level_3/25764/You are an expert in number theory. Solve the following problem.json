    "solution": "First, we find $150=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2.$ The prime factorization of a divisor of 150 must take the form $2^m3^n5^p$ for nonnegative integers $m\\leq 1$, $n\\leq 1$, and $p\\leq 2$. The requirement that the divisor is not divisible by 5 means that we must have $p=0$. Therefore, there are $2$ possibilities for $m$ (namely, 0 or 1) and the same for $n$ for a total of $2\\cdot 2=\\boxed{4}$ such factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by 5, we first need to factorize $150$ into its prime factors: $150 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2$.\n\nAny divisor of $150$ that is not divisible by 5 must not contain any factors of 5. This means that we can choose either $0$ or $1$ factor of 5 for each of the prime factors 2 and 3.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, we have 2 options: we can either include it or exclude it.\n\nFor the prime factor 3, we also have 2 options: include it or exclude it.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive divisors of $150$ that are not divisible by 5 is $2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{4}$.",
