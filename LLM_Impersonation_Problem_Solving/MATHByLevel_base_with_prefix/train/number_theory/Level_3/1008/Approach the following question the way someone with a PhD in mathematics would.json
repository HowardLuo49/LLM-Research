    "solution": "The last digit of a square must be either $1$, $4$, $5$, $6$, or $9$. Therefore, we only need to consider these squares. Only one square begins and ends with $1: 121$. Similarly, one square begins and ends with $4: 484$. No square begins and ends with $5$. One square begins and ends with $6: 676$. No square begins and ends with $9$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{3}$ squares which are $3$-digit palindromes.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many three-digit squares are palindromes, we first need to identify the range of three-digit numbers whose squares are three-digit palindromes. Let $N$ be a three-digit number, with the hundreds digit represented by $a$, the tens digit represented by $b$, and the units digit represented by $c$. The square of $N$ is given by:\n\n$$N^2 = (100a + 10b + c)^2 = 10000a^2 + 1000(2ab) + 100(2ac + b^2) + 10(2bc) + c^2$$\n\nSince $N^2$ is a three-digit number, we can deduce the following constraints:\n\n1. $a^2$ should be non-zero, as we are looking for three-digit squares.\n2. $2ab$ can range from $0$ to $9$, as the tens digit of a three-digit number can only be between $0$ and $9$.\n3. $2ac + b^2$ should be a single-digit number, as the hundreds digit of a three-digit number can only be between $1$ and $9$.\n4. $2bc$ can range from $0$ to $9$.\n5. $c^2$ should be a single-digit number.\n\nWith these constraints in mind, we can now systematically list the possible palindromic squares. \n\nBy trial and error or using programming, we can find that the following three-digit squares are palindromes:\n$$121, 484, 676, 696, 121, 484, 676, 696$$\n\nTherefore, there are $4$ such three-digit squares that are palindromes.",
