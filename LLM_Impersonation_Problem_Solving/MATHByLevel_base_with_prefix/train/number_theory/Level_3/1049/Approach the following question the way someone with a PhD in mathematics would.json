    "solution": "If the $24$th is a Saturday, the $17$th was also a Saturday, as were the $10$th and the $3$rd.  So the $2$nd was a Friday and the $1$st was a $\\boxed{\\text{Thursday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we can use modular arithmetic. Let $x$ represent the number of days in the month up to the $24^\\text{th}$ day. Since there are 7 days in a week, and $24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, we have that $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nGiven that the $24^\\text{th}$ day is a Saturday, which is the $6^\\text{th}$ day of the week, we can express this as $x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nSolving the system of congruences, we have $x \\equiv 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $x \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. The solution to this system is $x \\equiv 17 \\pmod{7}$. \n\nTherefore, the first day of the month was 17 days before the $24^\\text{th}$ day, which is a Saturday. Since $17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$, the first day of the month was a Wednesday.",
