    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number, we need to consider the possible values of the units digit when squaring the numbers 0 to 9.\n\nWhen we square 0, we get 0 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 1, we get 1 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 2, we get 4 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 3, we get 9 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 4, we get 6 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 5, we get 5 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 6, we get 6 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 7, we get 9 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 8, we get 4 as the units digit. \nWhen we square 9, we get 1 as the units digit. \n\nThus, the distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of 6 distinct digits.",
