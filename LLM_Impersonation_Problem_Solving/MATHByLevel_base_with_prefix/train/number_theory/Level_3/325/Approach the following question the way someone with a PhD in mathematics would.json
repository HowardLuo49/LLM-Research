    "solution": "Let $d$ be the last digit of a number $n$.  Then $n^2 \\equiv d^2 \\pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $n^2$ is the same as the units digit of $d^2$.  Checking all the digits from 0 to 9, we find that the possible units digits of $d^2$ are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, for a total of $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, we can first consider the possible units digits of perfect squares. The square of any integer will have a units digit that is the product of two identical digits, since squaring a number essentially involves multiplying it by itself. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of every perfect square must be one of the following digits: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. These are the only digits that can result from squaring an integer. \n\nSo, there are a total of 6 distinct digits that can appear as the units digit of an integral perfect-square number: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.",
