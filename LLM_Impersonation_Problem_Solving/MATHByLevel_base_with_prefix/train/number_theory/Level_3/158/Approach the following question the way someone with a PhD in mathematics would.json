    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the integer $n$ that satisfies $-1111\\equiv n\\pmod 9$ with $0\\le n<9$, we must first understand the concept of congruence modulo $9$. \n\nCongruence modulo $9$ means that the two numbers are equivalent in the sense that they have the same remainder when divided by $9$. In this case, we are given that $-1111$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $9$. \n\nTo find the integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence, we can first calculate the remainder when $-1111$ is divided by $9$. This can be done by dividing $-1111$ by $9$:\n\n$$-1111 \\div 9 = -123 \\text{ remainder } 4$$\n\nTherefore, we have that $-1111\\equiv 4\\pmod 9$. Since we want an integer $n$ that satisfies $0\\le n<9$, we can see that $n=4$ is the solution to the given congruence. \n\nTherefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $-1111\\equiv n\\pmod 9$ with $0\\le n<9$ is $n=4$.",
