    "solution": "An integer is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$. Using this fact, we find that the greatest multiple of $9$ that is less than $-1111$ is $-1116$.\n\nWe have $-1111 = -1116+5$. That is, $-1111$ is equal to a multiple of $9$ plus $5$. Therefore, $$-1111\\equiv \\boxed{5}\\pmod 9.$$To verify this answer, we can check that $9$ divides $(-1111)-5 = -1116$; it does, so our answer is correct.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the value of $n$ that satisfies the congruence $-1111\\equiv n \\pmod 9$, we need to first reduce the left side modulo $9$.\n\nTo reduce $-1111$ modulo $9$, we add multiples of $9$ until we reach a number between $0$ and $8$:\n\n$-1111 = -123 \\times 9 + 6$\n\nTherefore, $-1111 \\equiv 6 \\pmod 9$. Hence, $n=6$ is the value that satisfies the given congruence.",
