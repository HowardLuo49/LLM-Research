    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we can consider the units digit of each factor individually and then determine the resulting units digit.\n\nFirst, let's identify the pattern in the units digit of the products of consecutive natural numbers. The units digit of a product is determined by the units digits of the factors. We can observe that the units digit of the product of any number multiplied by a number ending in 1, 5, 6, or 0 is always 0. Therefore, any number ending in 1, 5, 6, or 0 effectively contributes a units digit of 0 to the overall product.\n\nSince all the numbers from 1 to 99 can be expressed as a product of their prime factors, we need to focus only on the units digit of the multiplication. The units digit of a product depends on the units digit of each factor. For example, when multiplying by numbers ending in 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, or 9, the resulting units digit will vary. However, since we are interested in the units digit of the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we need to only consider numbers ending in 1, 5, 6, or 0. \n\nSince there are multiple numbers ending in 0, the product will certainly end in 0. Therefore, the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, is 0.",
