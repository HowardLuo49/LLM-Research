    "solution": "$99!$, the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, includes the product $2\\times5=10$, and since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, the units digit of 99! is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99, we can look for patterns in the units digits of the numbers being multiplied.\n\nFirst, we can group the numbers by their units digit:\n- All numbers that end in 0 will contribute a 0 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 1 will contribute a 1 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 2 will contribute a 2 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 3 will contribute a 3 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 4 will contribute a 4 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 5 will contribute a 5 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 6 will contribute a 6 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 7 will contribute a 7 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 8 will contribute an 8 to the units digit of the product.\n- All numbers that end in 9 will contribute a 9 to the units digit of the product.\n\nFrom the list above, we can see that the resulting units digit of the product will be zero because there are multiples of 2 and 5 in the list of natural numbers from 1 to 99. \n\nTherefore, the units digit in the product of all natural numbers from 1 to 99 is 0.",
