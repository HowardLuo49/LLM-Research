    "solution": "We claim that a number has an odd number of positive factors if and only if it is a perfect square. Indeed, for all non-square numbers $x$, we can pair each factor $f$ with another factor $\\frac{x}{f}$, so there must be an even number of factors. For perfect squares, this argument fails only for $\\sqrt{x}$, so there are an odd number of factors for perfect squares. Thus we seek the greatest perfect square below $100$, which is $\\boxed{81}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest whole number less than $100$ with an odd number of positive factors, we must consider the prime factorization of each number. The number of factors a number has is determined by the exponents in its prime factorization.\n\nA number with an odd number of factors must be a perfect square, as each factorization is paired with its reciprocal. In other words, for a factorization like $2^a * 3^b * 5^c * ...$, the total number of factors will be $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)...$. \n\nTherefore, to find the greatest whole number less than $100$ with an odd number of factors, we must look for the largest perfect square less than $100$. The largest perfect square less than $100$ is $81 = 9^2$, which has $3$ as the only factor besides $1$ and itself. Thus, the greatest whole number less than $100$ with an odd number of positive factors is $81$.",
