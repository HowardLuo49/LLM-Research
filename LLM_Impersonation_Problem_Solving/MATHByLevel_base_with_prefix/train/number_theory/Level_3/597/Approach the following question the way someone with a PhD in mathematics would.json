    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. You recently bought more than 100 eggs. The eggs are sorted in containers that can store exactly 12 eggs. However, upon inspecting the containers, you realize that two containers each hold only 11 eggs, while all the other containers hold 12 eggs. What is the smallest number of eggs you could have right now?",
    "solution": "If the two containers that held 11 eggs each held 12 eggs, then the number of eggs that you have would have been a multiple of 12. However, two eggs were removed, so the number of eggs you can have is two less than a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of eggs you could have can be written in the form $12c-2$, where $c$ represents the number of containers you have. As a result, we would like to solve the inequality $12c-2 > 100$, which has solution $c > 8\\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, since the number of containers must be an integer, we must have $c=9$, so the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is $12(9) - 2 = \\boxed{106}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Consider the total number of eggs as x. We know that the containers that hold 11 eggs each are only 2 out of the total number of containers, so the total number of eggs in those containers is 11*2 = 22 eggs.\n\nTherefore, we can express the total number of eggs in terms of the number of containers that hold 12 eggs:\nx = 12*(total number of containers) + 22\n\nSince we know that the total number of containers is an integer, let's denote it as n. Substituting this into our equation:\n\nx = 12n + 22\n\nWe are also given that the total number of eggs is more than 100, so x > 100. Substituting this into our equation:\n\n12n + 22 > 100\n\n12n > 78\n\nn > 6.5\n\nSince n must be an integer, the smallest possible value for n is 7. Therefore, the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is when n = 7:\n\nx = 12*7 + 22\nx = 84 + 22\nx = 106\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of eggs you could have right now is 106.",
