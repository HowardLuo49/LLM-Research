    "solution": "The largest power of 6 less than 515 is $6^3=216$, and the largest multiple of 216 less than 515 is $2\\cdot216=432$. That means there is a 2 in the $6^3$ place. We have $515-432=83$ left. The largest multiple of a power of 6 that is less than 83 is $2\\cdot6^2=72$. There is a 2 in the $6^2$ place. Now we're left with $83-72=11$, which can be represented as $1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0$. So, we get $515=2\\cdot6^3+2\\cdot6^2+1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0=\\boxed{2215_6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To express the base-10 integer 515 in base 6, we need to find the largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 515. This can be done by finding 6^n where 6^n is less than or equal to 515, and n is the largest possible integer.\n\nThe largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 515 is 6^3, which is equal to 216. \n\nTherefore, we know that the first digit in the base-6 representation of 515 will be 3, as 3*216=648 which is greater than 515.\n\nNext, we need to find the remainder after subtracting 3*216 from 515, which is 515 - 3*216 = 83.\n\nThe next largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 83 is 6^2, which is equal to 36. \n\nThus, the second digit in the base-6 representation of 515 will be 2, as 2*36=72 which is less than 83.\n\nLastly, we find the remainder after subtracting 2*36 from 83, which is 83 - 2*36 = 11.\n\nTherefore, the last digit in the base-6 representation of 515 will be 1, as 1*6=6 which is less than 11.\n\nPutting it all together, the base-6 representation of 515 is 321.",
