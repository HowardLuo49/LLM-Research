    "solution": "The prime factorization of 50 is $2\\cdot5^2$ and the prime factorization of 5005 is $5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13$. The greatest common divisor is 5 and the least common multiple is $2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13=2\\cdot5\\cdot5005=50050$. The sum of the GCD and LCM is $\\boxed{50055}$.",

We have:\n\n$5005 = 50 \\times 100 + 5$\n$50 = 5 \\times 10$\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of $50$ and $5005$ is the greatest common divisor of $5$ and $50$, which is $5$.\n\nTo find the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$, we can use the formula:\n\n$\\text{LCM}(a,b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCD}(a,b)}$\n\nSo, the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$ is:\n\n$\\text{LCM}(50, 5005) = \\frac{50 \\times 5005}{5} = 50 \\times 1001 = 50050$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the greatest common divisor of $50$ and $5005$ and the least common multiple of $50$ and $5005$ is:\n\n$5 + 50050 = \\boxed{50055}$",
