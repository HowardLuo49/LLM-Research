    "solution": "We begin by converting $403_{10}$ into base-7. Since $7^3=343$ is the largest power of 7 that is less than 403, and it can go into the given number once, the coefficient of the $7^3$ term will be 1. From here, we are left with a remainder of $403-343=60$. The largest power of 7 less than this number is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 that is less than 60 is $1\\cdot49=49$ itself. This leaves us with $60-49=11$, which we can express as $1\\cdot7^1+4\\cdot7^0$. So, we find that $403_{10}=1\\cdot7^3+1\\cdot7^2+1\\cdot{7^1}+4\\cdot7^0=1114_7$, which only has $\\boxed{1}$ even digit.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of even digits in the base-7 representation of $403_{10}$, we first need to convert the decimal number $403_{10}$ into base-7.\n\nTo do this, we start by finding the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 403. We see that $7^3=343$ is the largest power of 7 that is less than 403. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$403_{10}=5*7^3 + 2*7^1 + 0*7^0$\n\nSo, $403_{10}=520_7$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of even digits in the base-7 representation of $403_{10}=520_7$. \n\nAn even digit in base-7 is any digit that is a multiple of 2. In base-7, the even digits are 0, 2, and 4. \n\nIn the base-7 representation of $520_7$, we have 2 even digits, which are the 2 in the units place and the 0 in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the number of even digits in the base-7 representation of $403_{10}$ is 2.",
