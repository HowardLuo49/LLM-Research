    "solution": "A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., digits less the sum of the second, fourth, sixth, etc., digits is itself a multiple of $11$. The former sum is $8+4+5+6=23$. The latter sum if $5+n+2=7+n$. Thus $23-(7+n)=16-n$ must be a multiple of $11$. This is satisfied only by $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "A number is divisible by $11$ if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of $11$. \n\nTherefore, for the number $854n526$ to be divisible by $11$, we have:\n\n$(8+5+4+5+2+6) - (n+5+2) = 20 - (n+7) = 13 - n$\n\nFor this to be divisible by $11$, we must have that $13 - n$ is a multiple of $11$. This means that $n$ must be equal to $2$ in order for $854n526$ to be divisible by $11$. \n\nTherefore, $n$ is equal to $\\boxed{2}$.",
