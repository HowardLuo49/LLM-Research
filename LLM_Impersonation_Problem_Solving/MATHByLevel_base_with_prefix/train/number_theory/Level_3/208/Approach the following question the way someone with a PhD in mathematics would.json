    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to convert the given number of people to base 10. \n\n$204_6 = 2\\cdot6^2 + 0\\cdot6^1 + 4\\cdot6^0 = 2\\cdot36 + 4\\cdot1 = 72 + 4 = 76$ \n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 76 people. \n\nSince 2 people are supposed to sit on one bench, we divide the total number of people by 2:\n\n$76 \\div 2 = 38$ \n\nThus, the bagel shop has 38 benches.",
