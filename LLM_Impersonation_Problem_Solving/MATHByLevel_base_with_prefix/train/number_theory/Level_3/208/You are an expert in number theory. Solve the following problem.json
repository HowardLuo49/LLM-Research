    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the number of people to base-10:\n\n$204_6$ = $2*6^2 + 0*6^1 + 4*6^0 = 2*36 + 0*6 + 4*1 = 72 + 0 + 4 = 76$\n\nSince each bench can sit 2 people, we divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches:\n\nNumber of benches = $\\frac{76}{2} = 38$\n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 38 benches.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 38?: To solve this problem, we need to convert the number of people to base-10:\n\n$204_6$ = $2*6^2 + 0*6^1 + 4*6^0 = 2*36 + 0*6 + 4*1 = 72 + 0 + 4 = 76$\n\nSince each bench can sit 2 people, we divide the total number of people by 2 to find the number of benches:\n\nNumber of benches = $\\frac{76}{2} = 38$\n\nTherefore, the bagel shop has 38 benches.",
