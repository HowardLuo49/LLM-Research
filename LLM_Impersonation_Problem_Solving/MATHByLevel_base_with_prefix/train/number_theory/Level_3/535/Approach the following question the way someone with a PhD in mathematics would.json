    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To convert $115_{10}$ to base 11, we need to find the largest power of 11 that is less than or equal to 115. The largest power of 11 less than 115 is $11^2=121$. Thus, we have:\n\n$115_{10} = 1\\cdot 11^2 + 4\\cdot 11^1 + 4\\cdot 11^0$\n\nTherefore, in base 11, $115_{10}$ is equal to $1 4 4_{11}$.\n\nSince $10$ must be represented as $A$ in base 11, the final representation of $115_{10}$ in base 11 is $144_{11}$.",
