    "solution": "A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself. If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$. Thus the \"prime\" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of prime numbers that are divisible by 39, we first need to factorize 39 into its prime factors. \n\n$39 = 3 * 13$\n\nSince 39 is divisible by both 3 and 13, a prime number that is divisible by 39 must also be divisible by either 3 or 13. Thus, we need to find the number of prime numbers that are divisible by 3 or 13. \n\nAll primes except 2 and 5 are odd numbers, so any prime number that is divisible by 3 must be 3 itself which is the only prime number that is divisible by 3. \n\nSimilarly, any prime number that is divisible by 13 must be 13 itself. \n\nTherefore, there is only 1 prime number (which is 3) among all the primes that are divisible by 39.",
