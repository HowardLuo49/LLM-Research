    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many prime numbers are divisible by $39$ ?",
    "solution": "A prime number is a number whose only divisors are $1$ and itself. If a prime were divisible by $39$, it would have to be divisible by $3$ and $13$ as well since $3$ and $13$ are factors of $39$. Thus the \"prime\" would have too many factors and wouldn't be a prime! Thus there are $\\boxed{0}$ primes which are divisible by $39$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many prime numbers are divisible by 39, we first need to understand the properties of prime numbers and the number 39. \n\nA prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In contrast, 39 is not a prime number as it has divisors other than 1 and itself (3 and 13). \n\nSince 39 is not a prime number, it cannot be evenly divided by any prime number. This is because prime numbers can only be evenly divided by 1 and themselves. Therefore, there are no prime numbers that are divisible by 39.",
