    "solution": "Let $n$ be the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.  In order for a number to be a perfect cube and a perfect square, it must be a perfect sixth power. Now we choose the smallest $a$ such that $n$ is four-digit: $2^6=64$, $3^6=729$, $4^6=4096$. Thus, $n=\\boxed{4096}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can start by listing out the perfect squares and perfect cubes that are closest to each other in the four-digit range:\n\n- The smallest four-digit perfect square is 31^2 = 961\n- The smallest four-digit perfect cube is 22^3 = 10648\n\nSo, we need to find a number greater than 961 and less than 10648 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube. Looking at the list, we can see that 4^2 = 16 and 2^3 = 8, so the least four-digit number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is:\n\n2^6 = 64\n\nTherefore, the least four-digit whole number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64.",
