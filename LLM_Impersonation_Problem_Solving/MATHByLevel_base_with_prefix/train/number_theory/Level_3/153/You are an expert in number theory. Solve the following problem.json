    "solution": "Since $77=7\\cdot11$, the divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. Their sum is $1+7+11+7\\cdot11=\\boxed{96}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77, we first need to find all the divisors of 77. \n\n77 can be factored into prime numbers as 7 x 11. \n\nThe divisors of 77 are 1, 7, 11, and 77. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 is: \n1 + 7 + 11 + 77 = 96. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer divisors of 77 is 96.",
