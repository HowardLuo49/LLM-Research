    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For what value of $n$ is the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ divisible by 33? (Note: the underlining is meant to indicate that the number should be interpreted as a five-digit number whose ten thousands digit is 7, whose thousands digit is $n$, and so on).",
    "solution": "Divisibility by $33$ requires that a number be divisible by both $11$ and $3$. If a five-digit number is divisible by $11$, the difference between the sum of the units, hundreds and ten-thousands digits and the sum of the tens and thousands digits must be divisible by $11$. Thus $(7 + 9 + 3) - (n + 3) = 16 - n$ must be divisible by $11$. The only digit which can replace $n$ for the number to be divisible by $11$, then, is $n = 5$. Furthermore, if a number is $7 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 27$, so the number is divisible by $3$. Hence, $n = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine if the five-digit number $\\underline{7n933}$ is divisible by 33, we can use the divisibility rule for 33, which states that a number is divisible by 33 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 33. \n\nTherefore, let's evaluate the alternating sum of the digits in $\\underline{7n933}$:\n$7 - n + 9 - 3 + 3 = 16 - n$\n\nIn order for the number to be divisible by 33, the alternating sum must be divisible by 33. Thus, our equation becomes:\n$16 - n = 33k$ where $k$ is an integer\n\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$n = 16 - 33k$\n\nSince $n$ must be a digit (i.e., between 0 and 9), we need to find a value of $k$ such that $n$ falls within the digit range. After some trial and error, we find that when $k = 0$, $n = 16$, which is not a valid digit.
