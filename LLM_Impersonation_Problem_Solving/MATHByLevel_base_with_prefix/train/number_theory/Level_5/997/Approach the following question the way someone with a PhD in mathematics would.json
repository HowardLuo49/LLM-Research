    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine for how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminates, we must consider the prime factorization of the denominator, 350. \n\nThe prime factorization of 350 is $2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$. In order for the decimal representation of a fraction to terminate, the denominator must be of the form $2^m \\times 5^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are non-negative integers. \n\nThus, $\\frac{n}{350}$ will have a terminating decimal representation if and only if $n$ is divisible by 2, 5, and 7. \n\nTo find the number of integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 that satisfy this condition, we find the number of integers between 1 and 349 that are divisible by both 2 and 5 (multiples of 10) and then determine which of those are also divisible by 7. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 34$ multiples of 10 between 1 and 349. Of these, $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{70} \\right\\rfloor = 4$ are also divisible by 7. \n\nTherefore, the number of integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminates is $\\boxed{4}$.",
