    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "The decimal representation of a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ terminates if and only if the denominator $b$ is of the form $2^m5^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers. \n\nIn this case, we are looking for the number of integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive such that $350 = 2\\cdot5^2\\cdot7$ divides $n$.
