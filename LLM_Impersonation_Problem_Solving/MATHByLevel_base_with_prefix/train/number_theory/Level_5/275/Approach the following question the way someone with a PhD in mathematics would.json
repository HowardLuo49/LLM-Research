    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$, we need to consider the multiplicative inverses of integers modulo 55 and 66.\n\nIn general, the multiplicative inverse of an integer $a$ modulo $n$ exists if and only if $a$ is relatively prime to $n$. That is, $\\text{gcd}(a,n) = 1$.\n\nFirst, let's examine the integers that have multiplicative inverses modulo 55. The integers that are relatively prime to 55 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54.

The smallest such integer is $\\boxed{5}$. $\\text{gcd}(5, 55) = 5$ and $\\text{gcd}(5, 66) = 1$, so the multiplicative inverses of 5 do not exist in both cases.",
