    "solution": "We can simplify as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n13(3x-2)&\\equiv 26 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x-2&\\equiv 2 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n9x&\\equiv 4\\cdot 3 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 12 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\n\\end{align*}So $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$ and all solutions are of this form. The solutions in the range $0<x\\le 20$ are $4,12,20$, so their sum is $4+12+20=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve the congruence $13(3x-2)\\equiv 26\\pmod 8$, we first expand the left-hand side to get $39x - 26 \\equiv 26\\pmod 8.$ \n\nNext, we simplify the congruence to get $39x \\equiv 52\\pmod 8.$ \n\nSince $39 \\equiv 7\\pmod 8,$ we can rewrite the congruence as $7x \\equiv 4\\pmod 8.$ \n\nNow, we find the inverse of $7$ modulo $8$. It is clear that $7\\cdot 7 = 49 \\equiv 5\\pmod 8$, so the inverse of $7$ modulo $8$ is $7$. \n\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence by $7$, we get $x \\equiv 28\\pmod 8$. \n\nThus, the positive integer solutions less than or equal to $20$ to the congruence are $x\\in \\{4,12,20\\}$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integer solutions less than or equal to $20$ to the congruence $13(3x-2)\\equiv 26\\pmod 8$ is $4+12+20=36$.",
