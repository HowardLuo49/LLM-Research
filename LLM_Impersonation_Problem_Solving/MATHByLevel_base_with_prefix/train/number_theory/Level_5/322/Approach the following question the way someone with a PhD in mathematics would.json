    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we must first consider the possible cases for each digit.\n\nLet's denote the three-digit integer as ABC, where A, B, and C are the hundreds, tens, and units digits respectively.\n\nSince the integer is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we have the following conditions:\n1. A is divisible by A, B is divisible by B, and C is divisible by C.\n2. A, B, and C are distinct non-zero digits.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for each digit:\n- A can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n- B can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (distinct from A).\n- C can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (distinct from A and B).\n\nTo maximize the three-digit integer, we should choose the largest possible values for A, B, and C that satisfy the conditions above.
