    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can start testing from the largest three-digit number downwards.\n\nLet's start with 987. The digits of 987 are 9, 8, and 7. 987 is not divisible by 9, as it leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. Therefore, 987 is not a valid solution.\n\nNext, let's try 975. The digits of 975 are 9, 7, and 5. 975 is not divisible by 9, as it leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. Therefore, 975 is not a valid solution.\n\nMoving on to 963. The digits of 963 are 9, 6, and 3. 963 is divisible by 9 (9 x 107 = 963), so 963 is a valid solution.\n\nThe largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 963.",
