    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Given a prime $p$ and an integer $a$, we say that $a$ is a $\\textit{primitive root} \\pmod p$ if the set $\\{a,a^2,a^3,\\ldots,a^{p-1}\\}$ contains exactly one element congruent to each of $1,2,3,\\ldots,p-1\\pmod p$.\n\nFor example, $2$ is a primitive root $\\pmod 5$ because $\\{2,2^2,2^3,2^4\\}\\equiv \\{2,4,3,1\\}\\pmod 5$, and this list contains every residue from $1$ to $4$ exactly once.\n\nHowever, $4$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 5$ because $\\{4,4^2,4^3,4^4\\}\\equiv\\{4,1,4,1\\}\\pmod 5$, and this list does not contain every residue from $1$ to $4$ exactly once.\n\nWhat is the sum of all integers in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ that are primitive roots $\\pmod 7$?",
    "solution": "Obviously, $1$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod 7$ (its powers are all congruent to $1$!).\n\nExamining the powers of $2$, we see that $\\{2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\} \\equiv \\{2,4,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ with repetition from this point onward. Since the powers of $2$ do not include all residues from $1$ to $6\\pmod 7$, we see that $2$ is not a primitive root.\n\nThe logic of this example can be generalized. If $a$ is an integer and $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$, then the powers of $a$ repeat on a cycle of length at most $k$. Therefore, for $a$ to be a primitive root, it is necessary that $a^k\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for all positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$. Conversely, if $a^k\\equiv 1\\pmod p$ for some positive $k$ smaller than $p-1$, then $a$ is not a primitive root $\\pmod p$. As examples, $4$ and $6$ are not primitive roots $\\pmod 7$, because $4^3\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$ and $6^2\\equiv 1\\pmod 7$.\n\nThis leaves $3$ and $5$ as candidates. Checking the powers of $3$ and $5$ modulo $7$, we see that \\begin{align*}\n3^1\\equiv 3,~ 3^2\\equiv 2,~3^3 \\equiv 6,~3^4\\equiv 4,~3^5\\equiv 5,~ 3^6\\equiv 1;\\\\\n5^1\\equiv 5,~ 5^2\\equiv 4,~5^3 \\equiv 6,~5^4\\equiv 2,~5^5\\equiv 3,~ 5^6\\equiv 1.\\,\n\\end{align*}Thus, $3,5$ are primitive roots of $7$, so the desired sum is $3+5=\\boxed{8}$.",
