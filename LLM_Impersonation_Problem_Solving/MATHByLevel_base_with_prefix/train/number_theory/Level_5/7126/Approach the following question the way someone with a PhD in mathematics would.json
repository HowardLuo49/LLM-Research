    "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find out how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$, we need to determine how many of the numbers $5^k$ for $0 \\leq k \\leq 2004$ have their first digit as $1$. \n\nIf $5^k$ begins with the digit $1$, then $10^x \\leq 5^k < 10^{x+1}$ for some integer $x$. This means $x \\leq k\\log_5 < x+1$, which can be simplified to $\\lfloor k\\log_5 \\rfloor = x$. \n\nSince $5^{2004}$ has $1401$ digits, we can deduce that $5^{1999}$ has $1400$ digits and lies between $10^{1400}$ and $10^{1401}$. Using the above relation with $k=1999$, we have $1399 \\leq \\lfloor 1999 \\log_{5} \\rfloor < 1400$. Therefore, there are $1400$ numbers in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$.\n\nIn conclusion, a PhD in mathematics would determine that there are $1400$ elements in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$.",
