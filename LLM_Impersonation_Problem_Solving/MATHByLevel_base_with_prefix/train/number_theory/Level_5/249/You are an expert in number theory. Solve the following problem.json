What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.",
    "solution": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base, we can start by listing out the 5-digit palindromes in base 2 and checking if they can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in another base.\n\nThe list of 5-digit palindromes in base 2 between 10000 and 11111 is:\n\n10001\n10101\n11011\n11111\n\nChecking each of these palindromes in binary, we find that the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in another base is 10101.\n\nConverting 10101 to decimal gives us the number 21, which is a palindrome in base 5 (101).\n\nTherefore, the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base is 10101 in base 2.",
