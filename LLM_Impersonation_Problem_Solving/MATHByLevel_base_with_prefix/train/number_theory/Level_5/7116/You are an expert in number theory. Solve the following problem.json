    "solution": "Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^y$. Substituting these values results in\\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\\]Factor the difference of squares to get\\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative. If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$. Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative. Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus,\\[a+b=55 \\text{ and } a-b=1\\]\\[\\text{or}\\]\\[a+b=11 \\text{ and } a-b=5\\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$. Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work. From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$. Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the equation as $2^{2x} = 3^{2y} + 55$. Note that $3^{2y}$ is always odd, so $3^{2y} + 55$ is always even. Therefore, $2^{2x}$ must be even as well, which implies that $x$ is a positive integer (if $x$ were negative, $2^{2x}$ would be a fraction). \n\nNow, note that $55 = 2^6 + 3^3$. Therefore, $2^{2x} = 3^{2y} + 2^6 + 3^3$. Rearranging, we get $2^{2x} - 2^6 = 3^{2y} + 3^3$. Factoring the left side, we have $2^{2x} - 2^6 = 2^6(2^{2(x-3)} - 1)$. \n\nSince $2^{2x} - 2^6$ is always even, this means that $2^{2(x-3)} - 1$ must be even as well. We conclude that $x$ must be $3$. Substituting $x=3$ into the original equation, we get $3^{2y} = 539 = 7^2 \\cdot 11$. Since $3^{2y}$ only has one factor of three, we find that $y=1$. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is $(x,y) = (3,1)$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\ 1}$.",
