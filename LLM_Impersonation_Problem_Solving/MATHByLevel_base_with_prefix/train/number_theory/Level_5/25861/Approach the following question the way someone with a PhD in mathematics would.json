    "solution": "Factor out $12!$ from both terms: $12!+14!=12!(1+13\\cdot 14)=12!\\cdot 183$.  Factor $183=3\\cdot 61$.  Since $12!$ has no prime factors greater than 11, $\\boxed{61}$ is the greatest prime factor of $12!+14!$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest prime factor of $12! + 14!$, we need to first factor out the common factors between the two terms. Notice that $12!$ is a factor of $14!$, so we can factor out $12!$ from both terms:\n\\[12! + 14! = 12!(1 + 13 \\cdot 14).\\]\nTherefore, $12! + 14! = 12! \\cdot 183 = 12! \\cdot 3 \\cdot 61$. \n\nNow, we need to determine the prime factorization of $12!$. To do this, we consider the prime factorization of each number from $1$ to $12$ and combine the primes into a single list. The prime factorization of $12!$ is:\n\\[12! = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11.\\]\n\nFinally, we can rewrite $12! \\cdot 3 \\cdot 61$ in terms of its prime factors:\n\\[12! \\cdot 3 \\cdot 61 = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 61.\\]\n\nThus, the greatest prime factor of $12! + 14!$ is $\\boxed{61}$.",
