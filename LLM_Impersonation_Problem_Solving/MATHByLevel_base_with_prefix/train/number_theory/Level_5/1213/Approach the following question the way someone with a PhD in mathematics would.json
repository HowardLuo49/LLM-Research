    "solution": "Let's investigate the ones digits of successive powers of each of the integers from 0 through 9.  At each step, we can throw away any digits other than the ones digits.  Take 8 as an example: $8^1$ ends in 8, $8\\times 8$ ends in 4, $8\\times 4$ ends in $2$, $8\\times 2$ ends in 6, $8\\times 6$ ends in 8, and the pattern repeats from there.  Therefore, the ones digits of $8^1, 8^2, 8^3, \\ldots$ are $8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 2, 6, \\ldots$.  The results for all the digits are shown below.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\nn & \\text{ones digit of } n, n^2, n^3, \\ldots \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \\ldots \\\\\n1 & 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \\ldots \\\\\n2 & 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, \\ldots \\\\\n3 & 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, \\ldots \\\\\n4 & 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n5 & 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, \\ldots \\\\\n6 & 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, \\ldots \\\\\n7 & 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 9, \\ldots \\\\\n8 & 8, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, \\ldots \\\\\n9 & 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, \\ldots \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]The lengths of the repeating blocks for these patterns are 1, 2, and 4.  Therefore, for any digit $d$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $d^a$ is $d$.  Also, if $n$ is a positive integer, then the ones digit of $n^a$ only depends on the ones digit of $n$. Therefore, for any positive integer $n$ and any exponent $a$ which is one more than a multiple of 4, the ones digit of $n^a$ is the ones digit of $n$.   Let us write ``$\\equiv$'' to mean ``has the same ones digit as.''  Since $2009$ is one more than a multiple of 4, we find \\begin{align*}\n1^{2009}+2^{2009}+\\cdots+2009^{2009} &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 +\\cdots 2009 \\\\\n&=\\frac{2009(2010)}{2} \\\\\n&= 2009(1005) \\\\\n&\\equiv 9\\cdot 5 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{5}.\n\\end{align*}",

The ones digit of $1^{2009}$ is always 1 because any number raised to the power of 2009 will have a ones digit of 1.\n\nNext, let's consider $2^{2009}$.
