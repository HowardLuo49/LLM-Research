If $1 \\le a \\le 251$, how many integral values of $a$ are there such that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$?\n",

Also, we note that by examining a couple of terms, $2^{2a} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 2$ and $2^{2a} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a|2$. Therefore,\\[a^{4} + 2^{2a} \\equiv \\{0,1\\} + \\{1,4\\} \\equiv \\{0,1,2,4\\} \\pmod{5}\\]With divisibility by $5$ achievable only if $a \\nmid 2,5$. There are $\\frac{251-1}{2}+1 = 126$ odd numbers in the range given, and $\\frac{245-5}{10}+1 = 25$ of those are divisible by $5$, so the answer is $126 - 25 = \\boxed{101}$.",
