    "solution": "If we fix $b$ then increasing $n$ increases the number of factors, so we want $n$ to equal $15$.  Recall that the number of prime factors of $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_m^{e_m}$ equals $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots (e_m+1)$, where the $p_i$ are primes.  Thus we want the exponents in the prime factorization of $b$ to be as large as possible.  Choosing $b=12=2^2\\cdot 3$ gives $e_1=2,e_2=1$.  Any other number less than or equal to $15$ will either be prime or will be the product of two primes, giving smaller exponents in the prime factorization.  Thus $b=12$ is the best choice, and we have $b^n=2^{30}3^{15}$, which has $(30+1)(15+1)=\\boxed{496}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "The number of positive factors a number has is equal to the product of one more than each of its prime factor's exponent. In this case, $b^n$ has prime factorization $b^n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ where each $p_i$ is a prime number and $e_i$ is a positive integer. Since $b$ and $n$ are both less than or equal to 15, the maximum number of prime factors in their prime factorizations is 15.\n\nFor $b = 2$ and $n = 15$, the prime factorization of $b^n$ is $2^{15}$. The number of its positive factors is $(15+1) = 16$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of positive factors $b^n$ can have is $\\boxed{16}$.",
