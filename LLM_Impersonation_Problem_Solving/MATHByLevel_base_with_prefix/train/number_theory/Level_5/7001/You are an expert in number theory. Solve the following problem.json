    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Mary told John her score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME), which was over $80$. From this, John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. If Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, John could not have determined this. What was Mary's score? (Recall that the AHSME consists of $30$ multiple choice problems and that one's score, $s$, is computed by the formula $s=30+4c-w$, where $c$ is the number of correct answers and $w$ is the number of wrong answers. (Students are not penalized for problems left unanswered.)\n",
    "solution": "Let Mary's score, number correct, and number wrong be $s,c,w$ respectively. Then\n$s=30+4c-w=30+4(c-1)-(w-4)=30+4(c+1)-(w+4)$.\nTherefore, Mary could not have left at least five blank; otherwise, one more correct and four more wrong would produce the same score. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four wrong (clearly Mary answered at least one right to have a score above $80$, or even $30$.)\nIt follows that $c+w\\geq 26$ and $w\\leq 3$, so $c\\geq 23$ and $s=30+4c-w\\geq 30+4(23)-3=119$. So Mary scored at least $119$. To see that no result other than $23$ right/$3$ wrong produces $119$, note that $s=119\\Rightarrow 4c-w=89$ so $w\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$. But if $w=3$, then $c=23$, which was the result given; otherwise $w\\geq 7$ and $c\\geq 24$, but this implies at least $31$ questions, a contradiction. This makes the minimum score $\\boxed{119}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote Mary's score as $s$ and the number of correct answers as $c$.\n\nSince John was able to determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly, we know that Mary's score is at least $81$. This means that $s \\geq 81$.\n\nIf Mary's score had been any lower, but still over $80$, then John couldn't determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. This means that there must be another score $s'$ such that $80 < s' < s$ and the number of correct answers for both $s$ and $s'$ are the same.\n\nFrom the formula $s=30+4c-w$, we can see that the number of correct answers $c$ must be an integer, since all the other factors are integers. This means that $s$ can only increase by $4$ if $c$ increases by $1$. Therefore, there is no other score $s'$ such that $80 < s' < s$ and the number of correct answers are the same.\n\nTherefore, Mary's score must be $81$.\n\nSo Mary's score was $81$.",
