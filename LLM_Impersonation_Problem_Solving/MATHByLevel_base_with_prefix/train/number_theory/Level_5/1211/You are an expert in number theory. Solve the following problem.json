    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?",
    "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of members in the band as n.\n\nFrom the given information, we can set up the following equations:\n\n8x = n - 2\n9y = n - 3\n\nwhere x and y are integers representing the number of members in each row when there are 2 and 3 positions unoccupied respectively.\n\nWe can rearrange the equations to solve for n:\n\nn = 8x + 2\nn = 9y + 3\n\nSince n is the same in both equations, we can set the right-hand sides equal to each other:\n\n8x + 2 = 9y + 3\n8x = 9y + 1\n\nThis equation tells us that 9y + 1 is divisible by 8. Looking at the possible values for y between 100 and 200, we find that y = 13 satisfies this condition.\n\nPlugging y = 13 back into the second equation, we find n = 9 * 13 + 3 = 120.\n\nTherefore, there are 120 members in the band.",
