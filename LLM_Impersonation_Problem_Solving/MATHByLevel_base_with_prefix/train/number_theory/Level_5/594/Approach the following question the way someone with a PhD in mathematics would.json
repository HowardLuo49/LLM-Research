    "solution": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we factorize $504$ into its prime factors: $504 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 7$. \n\nThe sum of the positive even factors can be found by considering the product of the factors of $504$ without the factor of $2$, and then multiplying the result by $2$. \n\nSince an even factor must contain at least one factor of $2$, all the factors of $504$ that are not divisible by $2$ are $3^a \\times 7^b$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 1$. \n\nThe sum of all such factors is:\n\\[(1+3)(1+7) = 4 \\times 8 = 32\\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by $2$ to account for the factor of $2$ gives us the sum of all positive even factors of $504$ as $64$.",
