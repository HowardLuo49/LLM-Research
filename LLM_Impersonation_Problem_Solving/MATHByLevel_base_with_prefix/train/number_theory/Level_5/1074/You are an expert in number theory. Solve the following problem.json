    "solution": "Note that $60$ is divisible by $3$, but $20$ is not divisible by $3$. Therefore, if $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$, then $\\nu$ must be divisible by 3 and we may write $\\nu=3n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).\n\nThus we have $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]=60$, and since the $3n$ contributes the factor of $3$ to $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[3n,20]$, it follows that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,20]=\\frac{60}{3}=20$. This is true if and only if $n$ is a divisor of $20$. Therefore, the possible values of $\\nu$ are $3$ times the positive divisors of $20$: $$\\nu = 3,6,12,15,30,\\,\\text{or}\\,60.$$The sum of these values is $\\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers can be found by multiplying the two numbers together and then dividing by their greatest common divisor (gcd).\n\nIn this case, we are given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$. We can rewrite this as $\\frac{\\nu \\cdot 20}{\\gcd(\\nu,20)}=60$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\gcd(\\nu,20)$, we get $\\nu \\cdot 20 = 60 \\cdot \\gcd(\\nu,20)$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $\\nu = 3 \\cdot \\gcd(\\nu,20)$. This means that $\\nu$ is a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $\\nu$ is a positive integer, the possible values for $\\nu$ are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, etc. We need to find the sum of all positive integers that satisfy this condition.\n\nTo find the sum, we notice that every number in the form of $3k$, where $k$ is a positive integer, satisfies the condition. So the sum of all such numbers can be expressed as $3(1+2+3+4+...)$.\n\nThis sum is an infinite series with a common difference of 1. The sum of an infinite series with a common difference of 1 can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $\\frac{a_1}{1-r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. In this case, $a_1=3$ and $r=1$, so the sum is $\\frac{3}{1-1} = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $\\nu$ for which $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[\\nu,20]=60$ is $\\boxed{3}$.",
