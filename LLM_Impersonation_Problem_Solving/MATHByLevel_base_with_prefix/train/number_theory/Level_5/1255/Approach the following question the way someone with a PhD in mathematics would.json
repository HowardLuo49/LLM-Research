    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65,a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65-(a+13)(2a+3),a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(2a^2+29a+65-(2a^2+29a+39),a+13)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(26,a+13).\n\\end{align*}Since $a$ is an odd multiple of $1183$, which is an odd multiple of $13$, $a+13$ must be an even multiple of $13$. This means that $26$ is a divisor  of $a+13$, so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{26}$.",

Substituting $a = 1183k$ into the expressions, we get:\n\n$2(1183k)^2 + 29(1183k) + 65 = 2(1183^2)k^2 + 29(1183)k + 65$\n\n$1183k + 13 = 1183k + 13$\n\nWe can simplify these expressions:\n\n$2(1183^2)k^2 + 29(1183)k + 65 = 2(1183^2)k^2 + 34(1183)k + 65$\n\n$1183k + 13 = 1183k + 13$\n\nFrom the expressions above, we see that $1183$ is a common divisor of both expressions.
