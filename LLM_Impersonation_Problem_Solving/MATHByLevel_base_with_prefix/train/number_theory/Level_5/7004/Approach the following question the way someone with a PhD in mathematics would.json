    "solution": "It follows from the givens that $a$ is a perfect fourth power, $b$ is a perfect fifth power, $c$ is a perfect square and $d$ is a perfect cube. Thus, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $a = t^4$, $b = t^5$, $c = s^2$ and $d = s^3$. So $s^2 - t^4 = 19$. We can factor the left-hand side of this equation as a difference of two squares, $(s - t^2)(s + t^2) = 19$. 19 is a prime number and $s + t^2 > s - t^2$ so we must have $s + t^2 = 19$ and $s - t^2 = 1$. Then $s = 10, t = 3$ and so $d = s^3 = 1000$, $b = t^5 = 243$ and $d-b=\\boxed{757}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can rewrite the equations $a^5 = b^4$ and $c^3 = d^2$ as $b = a^{\\frac{5}{4}}$ and $d= c^{\\frac{3}{2}}$, respectively. \n\nSince $c - a = 19$, we can substitute $c = a + 19$ into the second equation to get $d = (a+19)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nNow, we want to find $d-b$, which is equal to $(a+19)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - a^{\\frac{5}{4}}$. To simplify this expression, we can first find a common denominator, which is $4$. \n\nWe rewrite $(a+19)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ as $((a+19)^{2})^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (a^2 + 38a + 361)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ and $a^{\\frac{5}{4}}$ as $a(a^{2})^{\\frac{1}{4}} = a(a^2)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = a^{\\frac{9}{4}}$.\n\nThe expression we want to compute is now $(a^2 + 38a + 361)^{\\frac{3}{4}} - a^{\\frac{9}{4}}$. \n\nThe difference of two fourth powers can be factored using the formula $x^4 - y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2)$.
