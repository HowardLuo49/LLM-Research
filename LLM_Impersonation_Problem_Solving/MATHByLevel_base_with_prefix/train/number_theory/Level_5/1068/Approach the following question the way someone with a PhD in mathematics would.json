    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",

This simplifies to $1*b^3 + 1*b^2 + 1*b + 1$.\n\nThe sum of the digits when $11^4$ is written out in base $b$ is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n\nNow we need to find the largest base $b$ such that the sum of the digits of $11^4$ in base $b$ is not equal to $2^4 = 16$.\n\nTo do this, we will write out the base-$b$ expansion of $11^4$ for various bases $b$ and calculate the sum of the digits until we find a base where the sum is not equal to 16.\n\nLet's start with the smallest possible base, which is $b=2$:\n$11^4 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15$.\n\nFor $b=3$:\n$11^4 = 1*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40$.\n\nFor $b=4$:\n$11^4 = 1*4^3 + 1*4^2 + 1*4^1 + 1*4^0 = 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 85$.\n\nFor $b=5$:\n$11^4 = 1*5^3 + 1*5^2 + 1*5^1 + 1*5^0$,\n$11^4 = 125 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 156$.\n\nWe continue this process and find that $b=5$ is the largest base for which the sum of the digits of $11^4$ in base $b$ is not equal to $16$.
