    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. When $11^4$ is written out in base 10, the sum of its digits is $16=2^4$. What is the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$?  (Note: here, $11^4$ in base $b$ means that the base-$b$ number $11$ is raised to the fourth power.)",
    "solution": "In any base, $11 = 10+1$, so we can think of $11^4$ as $(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)(10+1)$. Expanded out, this is $$10^4 + 4(10^3) + 6(10^2) + 4(10) + 1.$$In base 7 or higher, this can be written as $14641$ (just as in base 10). Put another way, when we multiply out $11\\times 11\\times 11\\times 11$ in base 7 or higher, there is no carrying, so we get $14641$ just as in base 10.\n\nHowever, in base 6, we have to carry from the $100$'s place, so we get $15041_6$, whose digits do not add up to $2^4$. So the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that $11^4$ is equal to $14641$ in base $10$. \n\nLet's consider the sum of the digits of $11^4$ in some arbitrary base $b$. Since $11^4 = b^4 + 4b^3 + 6b^2 + 4b + 1$ in base $10$, the sum of the digits in base $b$ is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 2(4) + 1 = 2^4 + 1$.\n\nSo, in order for the sum of the digits not to be $2^4$, we must have $2^4 + 1 \\le b$. Therefore, the largest possible base $b$ is $17$. \n\nTo verify that $b = 17$ indeed works, we can convert $11^4 = 14641$ in base $10$ to base $17$. We have:\n$14641 = 1 \\cdot 17^4 + 4 \\cdot 17^3 + 6 \\cdot 17^2 + 4 \\cdot 17 + 1$.\n\nTherefore, in base $17$, the sum of the digits is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16 = 2^4$, which satisfies the condition. \n\nTherefore, the largest base $b$ such that the base-$b$ digits of $11^4$ do not add up to $2^4$ is $\\boxed{17}$.",
