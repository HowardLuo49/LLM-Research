    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of primes in the sequence, we first calculate the value of $P$. \n$P = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\ldots \\times 61$\n$P$ represents the product of all primes less than or equal to $61$, which is $P = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 19 \\times 23 \\times 29 \\times 31 \\times 37 \\times 41 \\times 43 \\times 47 \\times 53 \\times 59 \\times 61$.\n\nGiven that the terms in the sequence are $P+2, P+3, \\ldots, P+59$, we need to determine which of these values are prime. We note that for any $n > 1$, $P+n$ will be divisible by $n$. Additionally, all integers between $2$ and $\\sqrt{P + 59}$ less than or equal to $59$ will also divide $P+n$. \n\nTherefore, the prime numbers in the sequence will be those of the form $P+n$ where $n$ does not have any divisors between $2$ and $\\sqrt{P + 59}$. Since $P$ is a large product of primes, $P+n$ will have multiple factors for most $n$, meaning it will be composite. \n\nThe exception to this is when $n$ is itself a prime number. If $n$ is a prime number, then $P+n$ will be prime since it will not have any divisors other than $1$ and itself. \n\nTherefore, the number of primes in the sequence will be equal to the number of prime numbers between $2$ and $59$, since each $P+n$ where $n$ is a prime number will be prime. \n\nCounting the number of primes between $2$ and $59$ gives us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 17}$ primes.",
