    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times\\ldots \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4,\\ldots, 59$. Let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 58$\n",
    "solution": "First, note that $n$ does not have a prime number larger than $61$ as one of its factors. Also, note that $n$ does not equal $1$.\nTherefore, since the prime factorization of $n$ only has primes from $2$ to $59$, $n$ and $P$ share at least one common factor other than $1$. Therefore $P+n$ is not prime for any $n$, so the answer is $\\boxed{}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We are given that $P$ is the product of all primes less than or equal to $61$. By definition, $P$ is divisible by all these primes, and thus $P$ is divisible by all nontrivial factors of all numbers of the form $P+n$. Therefore, the only primes that can appear in the given sequence are $2, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots, 61$.\n\nHowever, notice that $P+1$ is not prime for $P > 1$, so we get rid of $2$ from the list.\n\nAlso, notice that for $n \\geq 4$, $P+n$ will be divisible by $4$. So, we get rid of $4$ from the list.\n\nSimilarly, notice that for $n \\geq 5$, $P+n$ will be divisible by $5$. So, we get rid of $5$ from the list.\n\nWe can continue this method and we notice the pattern: every prime number less than $61$ will be canceled out except for $2, 3, 5, 7$.\n\nTherefore, the number of primes appearing in this sequence is $4$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) } 0}$.",
