    "solution": "If $n^2-19n+99=x^2$ for some positive integer $x$, then rearranging we get $n^2-19n+99-x^2=0$. Now from the quadratic formula,\n$n=\\frac{19\\pm \\sqrt{4x^2-35}}{2}$\nBecause $n$ is an integer, this means $4x^2-35=q^2$ for some nonnegative integer $q$. Rearranging gives $(2x+q)(2x-q)=35$. Thus $(2x+q, 2x-q)=(35, 1)$ or $(7,5)$, giving $x=3$ or $9$. This gives $n=1, 9, 10,$ or $18$, and the sum is $1+9+10+18=\\boxed{38}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2-19n+99$ is a perfect square, we can treat $n^2-19n+99$ as the quadratic equation $y = n^2-19n+99$ and set it equal to a perfect square $x^2$. This gives us the equation $n^2-19n+99 = x^2$. We can then rearrange this equation to $n^2-19n+(99-x^2)=0$. Since we want $n$ to be an integer, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square itself.\n\nThe discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $D=b^2-4ac$. In this case, the discriminant is $(-19)^2-4(99-x^2)$. We want this to be a perfect square, so let's denote it as $y^2$.\n\nThus, we have $y^2 = (-19)^2-4(99-x^2)$. This simplifies to $y^2 = 361 + 4x^2 - 396 = 4x^2 - 35$. \n\nTo find the possible values of $x$ that make this a perfect square, we first note that $4x^2 - 35$ is always odd. Therefore, $y^2$ must be odd as well. This means that $y$ must be odd.\n\nLet $y = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this into $y^2 = 4x^2-35$, we get $(2m+1)^2 = 4x^2 - 35$. Expanding and rearranging, we get $4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4x^2 - 35$, which simplifies to $4m^2 + 4m + 36 = 4x^2$. Dividing by 4 gives us $m^2 + m + 9 = x^2$. \n\nThis equation represents a family of Pythagorean triples in which $m$ and $x$ are related by $m^2 + m + 9 = x^2$. By analyzing this equation further, we can find the possible integer pairs $(m,x)$ that satisfy it.\n\nThe sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2-19n+99$ is a perfect square comes from the solutions to $m$ in the above Pythagorean equation. By solving for $m$, we can find the corresponding $n$ and sum them all up.\n\n---\n\nFor the second part of the question, where we aim to find the sum of all integers $n$ such that $\\dfrac{12}{n}$ is also an integer, we must consider the possible integer values of $n$ that divide $12$ evenly. In other words, we need to find the factors of 12 and sum those that result in integer quotients.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The sum of these divisors that produce integer quotients when 12 is divided by them would be the desired sum of all integers $n$. Therefore, the sum of all integers $n$ such that $\\dfrac{12}{n}$ is an integer is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28.",
