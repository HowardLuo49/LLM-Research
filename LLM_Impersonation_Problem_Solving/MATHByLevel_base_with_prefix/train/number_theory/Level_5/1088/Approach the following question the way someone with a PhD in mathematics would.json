    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers that have four digits in base $2$. What is the sum of all of the elements in $S$, when expressed in base $2$?",
    "solution": "Any number in $S$ has a leftmost (eights) digit that is equal to $1$. The remaining three digits can either be $0$ or $1$, so there are a total of $2^3 = 8$ elements in $S$. Notice that element $x$ in $S$ can be paired with another element $10111_2-x$, which is the base $2$ number whose right-most three digits are the opposite of those of $x$. Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is equal to $4 \\times 10111_2 = 100_2 \\times 10111_2 = \\boxed{1011100}_2$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we must first understand what it means for a positive integer to have four digits in base 2. A four-digit number in base 2 ranges from $2^3$ to $2^4 - 1$, which in decimal form is from 8 to 15.\n\nWe can write out the set $S$ as $\\{1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111\\}$.\n\nTo find the sum of all of the elements in $S$ when expressed in base 2, we convert each element to decimal, sum them up, and then convert the sum back to base 2.\n\nIn decimal form, $S$ is $\\{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\}$.
