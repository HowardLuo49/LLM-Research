    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?",
    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the different counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we can use modular arithmetic. \n\nLet's denote the counting numbers as x and set up the equation:\n\nx \u2261 5 (mod 47)\n\nThis means that x leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 47. \n\nTo find all the possible values of x, we can add multiples of 47 to the remainder 5:\n\nx = 5, 52, 99, 146, 193, ...\n\nWe see that each number in the sequence differs by a multiple of 47. \n\nTherefore, there are infinitely many counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
