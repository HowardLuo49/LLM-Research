    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. The sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?",
    "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence, we can first list out the terms and observe a pattern.\n\nThe first few terms of the sequence are: 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, 111, 115, 118, 121, 151, 181, ...\n\nFrom this, we can see that after the first six terms (12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81), the pattern starts repeating with the ones digit increasing by 1 each time until it reaches 9 and then carries over to the next digit.\n\nThis means that the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term will be in the format of $1\\boxed{\\_\\_}$, where the blanks can be filled with any digit from 0 to 9. There are 10 possible choices for the last two digits, and 50 - 6 = 44 terms after the initial six.\n\nTherefore, the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence will be the $44^{\\text{th}}$ term in the repeating pattern of two-digit numbers that end in 1, which is 121. \n\nThe $50^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is $\\boxed{121}$.",
