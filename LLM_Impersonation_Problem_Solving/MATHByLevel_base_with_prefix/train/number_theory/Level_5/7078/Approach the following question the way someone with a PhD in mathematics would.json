Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers.\n",
    "solution": "Assume that the largest geometric number starts with a $9$. We know that the common ratio must be a rational of the form $k/3$ for some integer $k$, because a whole number should be attained for the 3rd term as well. When $k = 1$, the number is $931$. When $k = 2$, the number is $964$. When $k = 3$, we get $999$, but the integers must be distinct. By the same logic, the smallest geometric number is $124$. The largest geometric number is $964$ and the smallest is $124$. Thus the difference is $964 - 124 = \\boxed{840}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest and smallest geometric numbers, we need to consider all possible geometric sequences formed by three distinct digits. We know that a geometric sequence takes the form $a, ar, ar^2$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.\n\nFirst, let's consider the smallest geometric number. The smallest distinct digits we can choose are $1, 2, 4$, giving us the sequence $124$. The smallest geometric number is therefore $124$.\n\nNext, let's consider the largest geometric number. The largest distinct digits we can choose are $7, 8, 9$, giving us the sequence $789$. The largest geometric number is therefore $789$.\n\nThus, the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $789 - 124 = 665$. So, the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is $665$.",
