    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors. What is the greatest of these three common divisors?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us analyze the factors of the numbers $90=2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5$ and $m=p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i$ are positive integers. \n\nSince $90$ has $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ divisors, we know that $m$ must have $8$ divisors as well in order for them to share exactly three divisors. \n\nThe number of divisors of a number $n=p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1) \\cdots (a_k+1)$. Since $m$ must have $8$ divisors, we must have that $a_1+1=8$, which implies $a_1=7$. Therefore, $m=p_1^7$ for some prime number $p_1$. \n\nThe common divisors of $90$ and $m$ are the factors of the intersection of the prime factorizations of $90$ and $m$. The intersection must contain all the primes that appear with a positive exponent in both prime factorizations. Since $90$ has $2$ and $5$ in its prime factorization, and $m$ has only one prime $p_1$, the greatest common divisor must be $\\text{gcd}(2,5,p_1)=1$.\n\nThus, the greatest common divisor of $90$ and $m$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",
