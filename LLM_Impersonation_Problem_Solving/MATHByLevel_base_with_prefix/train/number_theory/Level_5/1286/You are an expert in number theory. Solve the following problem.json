    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Two numbers $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors. What is the greatest of these three common divisors?",
    "solution": "Recall that the common divisors of two integers are precisely the divisors of the greatest common divisor. So, for two numbers to have exactly three positive divisors in common, those divisors must be $1$, $p$, and $p^2$ such that $p$ is prime. We now look at the prime factorization of $90$: $90=2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Since $3^2$ is the only perfect square divisor of $90$, the divisors that $90$ and $m$ share must be $1$, $3$, and $9$. The largest of these three numbers is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the prime factorization of $90$ be $2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$.\n\nSince $90$ has $3$ distinct prime factors, it has $\\tau(90) = (1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 12$ factors. Therefore, the only way for $90$ to have exactly $3$ positive divisors is if $90$ is a perfect square.\n\nLet $m = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers. Since $90$ and $m$ have exactly $3$ positive divisors in common, $m$ must also be a perfect square. Thus, $m = 2^{2d} \\cdot 3^{2e} \\cdot 5^{2f}$, where $d, e, f$ are integers.\n\nSince $90$ and $m$ share exactly three positive divisors, the greatest common divisor of the two numbers must be a square of a prime divisor of $90$ that is also a prime divisor of $m$. The only prime factor that satisfies this condition is $3$. Therefore, the greatest of the three common divisors is $3^2 = \\boxed{9}$.",
