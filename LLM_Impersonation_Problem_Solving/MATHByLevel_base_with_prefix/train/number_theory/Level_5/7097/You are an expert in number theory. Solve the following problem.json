    "solution": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$. Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$. Thus, it is easy to verify this is minimal and we get $\\boxed{407}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We see that $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. Since $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, this means that $m+n$ cannot have any of the prime factors $2, 3, 5, 7$. Thus, $m+n$ must be a multiple of $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 = 210$.\n\nSince $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$ and $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, this means that $m$ must be divisible by $n$. Let $m = kn$ for some positive integer $k$. Then, $m^m = (kn)^{kn} = k^{kn}n^{kn}$.\n\nSince $m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n$, this means that $k^{kn}$ must be a multiple of $n^{n-1}$. Since $\\gcd(m+n,210)=1$, this means that $n$ cannot have any prime factors of $2, 3, 5, 7$. Therefore, $n$ must be at least 11, as $11^1$ is divisible by $11^{11-1} = 11^{10}$.\n\nLet $n = 11$. Testing $n = 11$, we see that $m = 11$ satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $11+11 = \\boxed{22}$.",
