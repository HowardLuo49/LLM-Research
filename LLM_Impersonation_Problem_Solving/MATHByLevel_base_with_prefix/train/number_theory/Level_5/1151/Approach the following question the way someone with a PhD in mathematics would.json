    "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the divisors of $8!$, we first calculate the prime factorization of $8!$. \n\n$8! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$\n\nAny divisor of $8!$ can be formed by choosing powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7 that are less than or equal to the exponents in the prime factorization of $8!$. \n\nTo find the divisors that are larger than $7!$, we look for divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $8 = 2^3$. Since $7!$ does not include a factor of $8$, we can see that any divisor with a factor of $8$ would be larger than $7!$. \n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$ is the same as the number of divisors of $7!$ that are less than or equal to $7!$, which is equal to the number of divisors of $7!$. \n\nThe number of divisors of $n!$, where $n$ is a positive integer, can be calculated using the formula $\\sigma_0(n!) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} (a_i + 1)$, where $n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $n$. \n\nFor $7! = 2^4 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7$, we have $k = 4$ and $a_1 = 4$, $a_2 = 2$, $a_3 = 1$, $a_4 = 1$. \n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of $7!$, which is the same as the number of divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$, is $\\sigma_0(7!) = (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 60$. \n\nIn conclusion, there are 60 divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$.",
