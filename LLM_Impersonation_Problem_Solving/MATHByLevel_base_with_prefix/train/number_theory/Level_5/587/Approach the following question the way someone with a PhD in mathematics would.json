    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ for all positive even integers $n$, we consider the prime factorization of the expression.\n\nFirst, note that all the numbers $n+1, n+3, n+5, n+7, n+9$ are consecutive odd integers. One of them is divisible by 3, one of them is divisible by 5, and so on. Therefore, at least one of the terms $(n+1), (n+3), (n+5), (n+7), (n+9)$ must have 3 as a factor and at least one of them must have 5 as a factor.\n\nNow, since $n$ is even, none of the terms $(n+1), (n+3), (n+5), (n+7), (n+9)$ is divisible by 2, and therefore no factor of 2 can appear in the prime factorization of the product.\n\nSo, the largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ for all positive even integers $n$ is $3 \\times 5 = 15$.",
