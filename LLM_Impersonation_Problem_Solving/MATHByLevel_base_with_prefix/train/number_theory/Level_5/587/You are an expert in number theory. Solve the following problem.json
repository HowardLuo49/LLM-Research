    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",
    "gpt_response": "By looking at the expression $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$, we can see that every consecutive group of five integers is being multiplied together, starting at $n+1$ and ending at $n+9$. Since we are looking for the largest integer that is a divisor for all positive even integers $n$, we can examine the expressions when $n$ is even.\n\nWhen $n$ is even, each of the five consecutive integers will include at least one odd number. When we multiply these five numbers together, the product will be odd.\n\nTherefore, for all positive even integers $n$, the expression $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ will always be odd. The largest integer that is a divisor of all odd numbers is 1, so the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.",
