    "solution": "We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$. In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.\n\nChecking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$. Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \\times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$, we need to consider how many factors of $2$ are present in the prime factorization of $(2^4)!$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $(2^4)!$ can be written as:\n\n$(2^{16})(2^{15})(2^{14})...(2)(1)$\n\nEach factor of $2$ contributes one power of $2$ to the prime factorization. Counting the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization gives us the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$.\n\nTo find the number of factors of $2$, we can use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$, which is given by:\n\n$\\sum\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^k}\\right\\rfloor$, where $k$ is a positive integer such that $p^k\\leq n$\n\nIn this case, we want to find the highest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$, so we substitute $p=2$ and $n=2^4$. The formula becomes:\n\n$\\sum\\left\\lfloor\\frac{2^4}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15$\n\nTherefore, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $2^{15}$. To find the ones digit of this power of $2$, we need to consider the cyclical pattern of powers of $2$. The ones digit of powers of $2$ follows a pattern of 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,... So the ones digit of $2^{15}$ is 8.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $\\boxed{8}$.",
