    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?",
    "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$, we need to consider the exponents of 2 and 7 in the prime factorization.\n\nA perfect square factor of a number will have even exponents for all of its prime factors. In this case, we are looking for factors of the form $2^{2m} \\cdot 7^{2n}$ where m and n are non-negative integers.\n\nThe exponent of 2 in $2^4$ is already even (4 = 2*2), so any factor of $2^4$ will have an even exponent of 2.\n\nThe exponent of 7 in $7^9$ is odd (9 = 2*4 + 1), so in order to create an even exponent of 7 in a factor, we will need to pair up the existing factors of 7. This means we can choose 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 factors of 7 to pair up, giving us a total of 5 choices.\n\nTherefore, the number of even perfect square factors of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ is equal to the number of choices for the exponent of 7, which is 5.",
