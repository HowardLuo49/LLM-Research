    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Recall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.  How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?",
    "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.",
    "gpt_response": "To answer this question, let us first consider the difference of two consecutive perfect squares. Let the two consecutive perfect squares be n^2 and (n+1)^2. The difference is then (n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n + 1.\n\nNow, we can express the perfect squares less than 10,000 as x^2, where x is an integer. We want to find how many of these perfect squares can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares.\n\nSetting x^2 = 2n + 1, we get n = (x^2 - 1)/2. This means that for x^2 to be the difference of two consecutive perfect squares, x^2 must be odd.\n\nSince x^2 is less than 10,000, x must be less than the square root of 10,000, i.e. x < 100. Considering only odd squares less than 10,000, we have x = 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 99. Using the formula n = (x^2 - 1)/2, we find the corresponding n values.\n\nThus, the perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares are the squares of 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 99, which is a total of 50 perfect squares.",
