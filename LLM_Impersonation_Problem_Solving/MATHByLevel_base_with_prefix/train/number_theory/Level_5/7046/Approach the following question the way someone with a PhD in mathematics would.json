It is known that, for all positive integers $k$,\n$1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}6$.\nFind the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$.\n",
    "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.",
    "gpt_response": "As someone with a PhD in mathematics, we approach this problem by first recognizing that the sum of the first $k$ perfect squares is given by the formula $\\frac{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}{6}$.\n\nWe are aiming to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that the sum of the first $k$ perfect squares is a multiple of $200$.

This may involve some trial and error, or possibly using algebraic techniques to simplify the equation.\n\nWhile we can continue to solve this equation analytically, it may be easier to set up a computer program or code to iteratively test values of $k$ to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the equation.",
