Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$.\n",
    "solution": "It's clear that we must have $a = 2^j5^k$, $b = 2^m 5^n$ and $c = 2^p5^q$ for some nonnegative integers $j, k, m, n, p, q$. Dealing first with the powers of 2: from the given conditions, $\\max(j, m) = 3$, $\\max(m, p) = \\max(p, j) = 4$. Thus we must have $p = 4$ and at least one of $m, j$ equal to 3. This gives 7 possible triples $(j, m, p)$: $(0, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), (3, 3, 4), (3, 2, 4), (3, 1, 4)$ and $(3, 0, 4)$.\nNow, for the powers of 5: we have $\\max(k, n) = \\max(n, q) = \\max(q, k) = 3$. Thus, at least two of $k, n, q$ must be equal to 3, and the other can take any value between 0 and 3. This gives us a total of 10 possible triples: $(3, 3, 3)$ and three possibilities of each of the forms $(3, 3, n)$, $(3, n, 3)$ and $(n, 3, 3)$.\nSince the exponents of 2 and 5 must satisfy these conditions independently, we have a total of $7 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{70}$ possible valid triples.",
    "gpt_response": "We start by factoring the numbers 1000 and 2000 in their prime factorizations. This yields $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$ and $2000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the least common multiple of two numbers $r$ and $s$ to help us approach this problem. The formula states that $[r,s] = \\frac{rs}{\\text{gcd}(r,s)}$, where gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.\n\nGiven that $[a,b] = \\frac{ab}{\\text{gcd}(a,b)} = 1000$, we know that $\\text{gcd}(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{1000}$. Similarly, $\\text{gcd}(b,c) = \\frac{bc}{2000}$ and $\\text{gcd}(c,a) = \\frac{ca}{2000}$.\n\nTherefore, we have two equations that we can explore:\n1) $\\text{gcd}(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{1000}$\n2) $\\text{gcd}(b,c) = \\frac{bc}{2000}$\n\nFrom equation 1, we can find that $\\text{gcd}(a,b) = 25$ or $40$. Similarly, from equation 2, we can determine that $\\text{gcd}(b,c) = 25$ or $40$ as well.\n\nWe can now consider all possible cases to find the ordered triples. Here are possible values for the triples:\n- (25, 40, 1000)\n- (40, 25, 1000)\n- (25, 40, 2000)\n- (40, 25, 2000)\n\nHence, there are four ordered triples that satisfy the given conditions.",
