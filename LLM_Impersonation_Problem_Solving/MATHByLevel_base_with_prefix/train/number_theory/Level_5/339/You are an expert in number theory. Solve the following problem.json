Solve the following problem. \"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x, y <m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graph of $$3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$$has a single $x$-intercept $(x_0,0)$ and a single $y$-intercept $(0,y_0)$, where $0\\le x_0,y_0<35$.\n\nWhat is the value of $x_0+y_0$?",
    "solution": "To find the $x$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $y$ and solve $$3x\\equiv 4(0)-1 \\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $$36x \\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$$and thus $x\\equiv -12\\pmod{35}$. Translating this to the interval $0\\le x<35$, we have $x\\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$, so the $x$-intercept on our graph is at $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we plug in $0$ for $x$ and solve $$3(0)\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}.$$We can rewrite this as $$1\\equiv 4y\\pmod{35}.$$Multiplying both sides by $9$, we get $$9\\equiv 36y\\pmod{35},$$and thus $y\\equiv 9\\pmod{35}$. So the $y$-intercept is at $(0,9)$.\n\nWe have $x_0+y_0 = 23+9 = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the $x$-intercept, we set $y=0$ in the equation $3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$, which gives us $3x\\equiv -1 \\pmod{35}$.\n\nWe need to find a value of $x$ such that $3x\\equiv -1 \\pmod{35}$. Since $35$ is relatively prime to $3$, the modular inverse of $3$ mod $35$ exists. The modular inverse of $3$ mod $35$ is $12$ since $3\\cdot 12\\equiv 1 \\pmod{35}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides by $12$, we get $x\\equiv -12 \\equiv 23\\pmod{35}$.\n\nSo, the $x$-intercept is $(23,0)$.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we set $x=0$ in the equation $3x\\equiv 4y-1 \\pmod{35}$, which gives us $-4\\equiv-1 \\pmod{35}$.\n\nSo, the $y$-intercept is $(0,4)$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $x_0+y_0$ is $23+4=\\boxed{27}$.",
