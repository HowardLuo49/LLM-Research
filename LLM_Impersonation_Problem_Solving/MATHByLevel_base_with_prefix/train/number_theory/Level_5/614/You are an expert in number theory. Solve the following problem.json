    "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and $e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_k$ are positive integers.\n\nSince $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, its prime factorization must be of the form $n=p^{10}$ where $p$ is a prime. Since $n$ is odd, $p$ must also be odd.\n\nThen the prime factorization of $8n^3$ is $(2^3)(p^{10})^3=8p^{30}$. Therefore the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is $(3+1)(30+1)=4\\cdot31=\\boxed{124}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 124?: Let $n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and $e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_k$ are positive integers.\n\nSince $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors, its prime factorization must be of the form $n=p^{10}$ where $p$ is a prime.
