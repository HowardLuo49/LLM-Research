    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, let's first consider a general method for determining if a number n can be divisible by a given integer k. If n is divisible by k, then it must also be divisible by all integers less than or equal to k. This means that n must be divisible by the product of all prime numbers less than or equal to k.\n\nIn this case, since exactly two friends were incorrect and they said consecutive numbers, let's call the incorrect numbers x and x+1. Since x and x+1 are consecutive, one of them must be even and the other odd. Therefore, at least one of them must be divisible by 2.\n\nLet's first consider the smallest prime numbers up to 5, as friends 1 to 5 mentioned them. The product of these primes is 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. This is the smallest possible integer up to 5 that is divisible by all the primes mentioned by the friends.\n\nNow, let's examine if 30 is divisible by 6 (friend 6's comment). Since 6 = 2 * 3, 30 is divisible by all the prime numbers up to 6 as well.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we find that 30 is divisible by all prime numbers up to 10. So, the smallest possible integer that satisfies the conditions given by the friends is 30.",
