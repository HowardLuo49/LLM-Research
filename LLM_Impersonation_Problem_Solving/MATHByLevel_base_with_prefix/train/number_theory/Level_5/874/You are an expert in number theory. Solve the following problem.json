    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?",
    "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$.",
    "gpt_response": "The two friends that were incorrect must have said consecutive numbers, so there are only two cases to consider: one friend said that the number can be divided by n, and the next friend said that the number can be divided by n+1.\n\nCase 1: One friend incorrectly said the number can be divided by 12 and the next friend incorrectly said the number can be divided by 13.\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 12, 13, and all numbers from 1 to 24. Therefore, the least common multiple of all these numbers is the least possible integer they were discussing.\nThis results in the least common multiple of 1,2,3,...,24 which is 30030.\n\nCase 2: One friend incorrectly said the number can be divided by 8 and the next friend incorrectly said the number can be divided by 9.\nIn this case, the number must be divisible by 8, 9, and all numbers from 1 to 24. Therefore, the least common multiple of all these numbers is the least possible integer they were discussing.\nThis results in the least common multiple of 1,2,3,...,24 which is 30030.\n\nTherefore, the least possible integer they were discussing is 30030.",
