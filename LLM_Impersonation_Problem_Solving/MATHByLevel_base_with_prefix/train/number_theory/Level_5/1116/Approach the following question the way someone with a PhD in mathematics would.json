    "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we must first recognize that in order for the fraction to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator.\n\nThus, we have the equation $2n - 1$ divides $20$. This means $20 = k(2n-1)$ for some integer $k$. This can be rewritten as $2n - 1 = \\frac{20}{k}$.\n\nSince $n$ is an integer, $\\frac{20}{k}$ must also be an integer. Therefore, $k$ can be any positive divisor of $20$, which are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$. \n\nFor each value of $k$, we solve for $n$ to find the corresponding integer values:\n1. When $k=1$: $2n - 1 = 20 \\Rightarrow n = \\frac{21}{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. When $k=2$: $2n - 1 = 10 \\Rightarrow n = \\frac{11}{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3. When $k=4$: $2n - 1 = 5 \\Rightarrow n = 3$.\n4. When $k=5$: $2n - 1 = 4 \\Rightarrow n = \\frac{5}{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$.\n5. When $k=10$: $2n - 1 = 2 \\Rightarrow n = \\frac{3}{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$.\n6. When $k=20$: $2n - 1 = 1 \\Rightarrow n = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer values of $n$ is $3 + 1 = 4$.",
