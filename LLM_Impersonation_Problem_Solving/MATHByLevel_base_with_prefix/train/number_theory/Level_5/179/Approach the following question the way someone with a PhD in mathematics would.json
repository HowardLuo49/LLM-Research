When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, their product is 200. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 200$.  The prime factorization of 200 is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 5^q$ and $b = 2^r \\cdot 5^s$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + r} \\cdot 5^{q + s}$.  But $ab = 200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, so $p + r = 3$ and $q + s = 2$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,r\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{q,s\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,r)$ are $(0,3)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,r\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 5^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$, and $2^1 \\cdot 5^1 = 10$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two integers be denoted by a and b. We are given that the product of their greatest common divisor (gcd) and least common multiple (lcm) is 200, i.e., gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = 200.\n\nWe know that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves, i.e., gcd(a,b) * lcm(a,b) = a * b. Therefore, we have a * b = 200.\n\nNow, in order to find the number of different values that could be the gcd of the two integers, we need to consider all the positive factors of 200.\n\nThe prime factorization of 200 is 2^3 * 5^2. Therefore, the total number of factors of 200 is (3+1)*(2+1) = 12.\n\nNow, we need to consider the ways in which these factors can be paired up to form combinations that could potentially represent the gcd of two numbers whose product is 200.\n\nFor example, if we choose 1 as the gcd, then the lcm would be 200. Similarly, if we choose 2 as the gcd, then the lcm would be 100. In general, if we choose a particular factor x as the gcd, then the other factor would be 200/x.\n\nTherefore, the number of different values that could be the gcd of the two integers is half of the total number of factors of 200, which is 12/2 = 6.\n\nHence, there are 6 different values that could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers.",
