For some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$. How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n",
    "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's start by writing out the prime factorization of $110n^3$. Since $110 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 11$, we have that $110n^3 = 2^1 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1 \\times n^3$. \n\nThe number of positive integer divisors of $110n^3$ can be calculated using the formula that if $n = p_1^{e1} \\cdot p_2^{e2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_k^{ek}$, the number of divisors of $n$ is $(e1+1)(e2+1)\\ldots (ek+1)$. \n\nApplying this formula to $110n^3$ (where $e_1 = e_2 = e_3 = 3$), we have that the number of positive integer divisors is $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(3+1) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 32$.\n\nSince $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, we have that $32 = 110$, which means $110n^3$ must be divisible by an additional $78$ prime factors (outside of $2, 5, 11, n$). \n\nMoving on to $81n^4$, we find that $81n^4 = 3^4 \\times n^4$. \n\nTo find the number of divisors of $81n^4$, we use the same formula as before, but with $e_1 = e_2 = 4$. This gives us $(4+1)(4+1)(1+1) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 50$ divisors.\n\nThus, the number $81n^4$ has $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 325}$ positive integer divisors.",
