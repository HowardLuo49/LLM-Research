    "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal. This means that the denominator must only have factors of 2 and 5. In other words, $n+101$ must be of the form $2^a5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers.\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n+101 = 2^a5^b \\geq 1$, so $101 = 2^a5^b - n \\geq 1$. This implies that $2^a5^b \\geq 102$, which gives us the smallest possible value of $a$ and $b$.\n\nFor $2^a5^b = 102$, a possible solution is $a=1$ and $b=1$, which gives us $n=2^1 \\cdot 5^1 - 101 = 10 - 101 = -91$. This is not a valid solution, as $n$ must be a positive integer.\n\nIf we move to the next possible value, $2^a5^b = 105$, a solution is $a=0$ and $b=1$, which gives us $n=2^0 \\cdot 5^1 - 101 = 1 \\cdot 5 - 101 = -96$. Again, this is not a valid solution.\n\nContinuing in this manner, we find that the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal is when $2^a5^b = 125$. In this case, a solution is $a=3$ and $b=1$, which gives us $n=2^3 \\cdot 5^1 - 101 = 8 \\cdot 5 - 101 = 39$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the given condition is $n=39$.",
