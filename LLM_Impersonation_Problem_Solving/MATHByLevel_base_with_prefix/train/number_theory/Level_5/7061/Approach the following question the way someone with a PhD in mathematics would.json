    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits. Find the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}.$\n",
    "solution": "Numbers of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\\frac{abc}{999}$. There are $10\\times9\\times8=720$ such numbers. Each digit will appear in each place value $\\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45. So the sum of all the numbers is $\\frac{45\\times72\\times111}{999}= \\boxed{360}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, we first denote $x = 0.\\overline{abc}$. Then, we can write $x = 0.abcabc... = abc \\times 10^{-3} + abc \\times 10^{-6} + abc \\times 10^{-9} + ...$\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with first term $abc \\times 10^{-3}$ and common ratio $10^{-3}$. The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is given by $\\frac{a}{1-r}$, so summing $x$ over all $a, b, c$ will give us the sum of all elements in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nSince $a, b, c$ are distinct digits, there are $9 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 648$ distinct elements in $\\mathcal{S$. Therefore, the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is $648 \\times \\frac{abc \\times 10^{-3}}{1-10^{-3}} = 648 \\times \\frac{abc}{999}$. \n\nHence, the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{216}{111}}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 360?: To find the sum of the elements in $\\mathcal{S}$, we first denote $x = 0.\\overline{abc}$.
