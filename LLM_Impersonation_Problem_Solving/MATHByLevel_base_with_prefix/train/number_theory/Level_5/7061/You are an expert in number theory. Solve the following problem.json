Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of real numbers that can be represented as repeating decimals of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ where $a, b, c$ are distinct digits. Find the sum of the elements of $\\mathcal{S}.$\n",
    "solution": "Numbers of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ can be written as $\\frac{abc}{999}$. There are $10\\times9\\times8=720$ such numbers. Each digit will appear in each place value $\\frac{720}{10}=72$ times, and the sum of the digits, 0 through 9, is 45. So the sum of all the numbers is $\\frac{45\\times72\\times111}{999}= \\boxed{360}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To represent a number of the form $0.\\overline{abc}$ as a fraction, we can call it $x = 0.\\overline{abc}$ and subtract it from $1000x = abc.\\overline{abc}$ to get $999x = abc$, which gives us $x = \\frac{abc}{999}$. \n\nWe know that $a, b, c$ are distinct digits, so the numbers $abc$ range from $102$ to $987$. To find the sum of all possible values of $x$, we need to find the sum of all possible fractions of the form $\\frac{abc}{999}$ where $abc$ ranges from $102$ to $987$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the sum of all integers from $102$ to $987$, excluding any multiples of $999$. We can do this by finding the sum of all integers from $1$ to $987$ and subtracting the sum of all multiples of $999$ from $1$ to $987$.\n\nThe sum of all integers from $1$ to $987$ is given by $\\frac{(1+987) \\cdot 987}{2} = 486108$. \n\nNext, we calculate the sum of all multiples of $999$ from $1$ to $987$. This is equivalent to finding the sum of all integers from $1$ to $987$ that are multiples of $999$, which is $999 + 1998 + \\ldots + 987 = 999 \\cdot (1 + 2 + \\ldots + 987)$. \n\nThe sum $1 + 2 + \\ldots + n = \\frac{n \\cdot (n+1)}{2}$, so in this case, the sum is given by $999 \\cdot \\frac{987 \\cdot 988}{2} = 488024713$.\n\nSubtracting this sum from the sum of all integers from $1$ to $987$, we get $486108 - 488024713 = -487538605$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all elements in $\\mathcal{S}$ is $-487538605$.",
