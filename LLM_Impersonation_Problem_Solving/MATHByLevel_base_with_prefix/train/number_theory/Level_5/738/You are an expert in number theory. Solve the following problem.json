    "solution": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)",

Mathematically, we can represent this as:\n\n\\[lcm(a,b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{gcd(a,b)}\\]\n\nGiven that the least common multiple of the two 6-digit integers has 10 digits, we have:\n\n\\(10^{9} \\leq lcm(a,b) < 10^{10}\\)\n\\(10^{9} \\leq \\frac{a \\times b}{gcd(a,b)} < 10^{10}\\)\n\nSince both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 6-digit integers, the product \\(a \\times b\\) will be a 12-digit number.
