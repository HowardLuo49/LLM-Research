    "solution": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of lattice points on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$, we need to find the integer solutions to this equation.\n\nFirst, observe that this equation can be rewritten as $(x+y)(x-y) = 2000^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, both $x+y$ and $x-y$ must be integers as well.\n\nLet $a = x+y$ and $b = x-y$. Thus, we have $ab = 2000^2$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $2000^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6$. This means that there are $(6+1)(6+1) = 49$ pairs of factors of $2000^2$. Therefore, there are 49 pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy $ab = 2000^2$.\n\nFor each pair $(a, b)$, we can solve the system of equations $x + y = a$ and $x - y = b$ to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that are integers.
