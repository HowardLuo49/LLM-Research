    "solution": "Notice that $n^3 - n$ factors as $n^3 - n = n(n^2 - 1) = (n-1)n(n+1)$. We observe that among any three consecutive integers, at least one must be divisible by $2$ and one must be divisible by $3$. Thus, we know that $6$ must always divide into $n^3 - n$. Indeed, this is the largest such integer; for $n = 6$, then $n^3 - n = 210 = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, and for $n = 33$, then $n^3 - n = 32 \\cdot 33 \\cdot 34 = 6 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$, whose greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $n$ be a composite integer. We want to find the largest integer that always divides into the difference between $n$ and the cube of $n$, i.e. $(n - n^3)$.\n\nNote that we can factor out $n$ from the expression to get $n(1 - n^2)$.\n\nSince $n$ is composite, it can be factored into $n = ab$ where $a, b \\neq 1$ are integers. Therefore, $n(1 - n^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2) = ab(1 - a^2b^2)$.\n\nSince $n$ is composite, $n$ is not prime and must have factors other than $1$ and $n$. Let $a$ be one of these factors. Since $a \\neq 1$ and $a \\neq n$, we have $0 < a < n$. Therefore, $0 < a^2 < n^2$ and $0 < a^2b^2 < n^2b^2$.\n\nThis implies that $1 - a^2b^2 > 0$, so $n(1 - n^2)$ is always positive.\n\nThus, the largest integer that always divides into $n(1 - n^2)$ for composite integers $n$ is $1$.",
