    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the integer be denoted as $N$. \nSince $N$ has $4$ digits in base $8$, we have $8^3 \\leq N < 8^4$. This implies $512 \\leq N < 4096$.\n\nLet $d$ be the number of digits in base $2$. Using the fact that $2^d \\leq N < 2^{d+1}$, we have $d \\leq \\log_2(N) < d+1$. This implies $d \\leq \\log_2(4095) < d+1$, which simplifies to $d \\leq 12 < d+1$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for $d$ are $d = 12$ and $d = 13$. The sum of all possible values of $d$ is $12 + 13 = \\boxed{25}$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 33?: Let the integer be denoted as $N$. \nSince $N$ has $4$ digits in base $8$, we have $8^3 \\leq N < 8^4$. This implies $512 \\leq N < 4096$.\n\nLet $d$ be the number of digits in base $2$. Using the fact that $2^d \\leq N < 2^{d+1}$, we have $d \\leq \\log_2(N) < d+1$.
