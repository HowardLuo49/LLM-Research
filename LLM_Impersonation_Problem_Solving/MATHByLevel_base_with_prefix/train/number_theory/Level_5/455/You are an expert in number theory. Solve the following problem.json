    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the integer be $n$. \n\nWe know that $1000_8 \\leq n < 10000_8$ since $n$ has $4$ digits in base $8$. \n\nConverting the lower bound to base $10$ gives $512 \\leq n < 4096$. \n\nNow, we need to find the range of $n$ in base $2$. Let $d$ be the number of digits of $n$ in base $2$. \n\nWe have $2^{d-1} \\leq n < 2^d$.\n\nFrom the range of $n$ in base $10$, we get $512 \\leq 2^{d-1} < 4096$.\n\nTaking logarithms, we get $9 \\leq d-1 < 12$, which gives $10 \\leq d < 13$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of $d$ are $10, 11, 12$. The sum of all possible values of $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
