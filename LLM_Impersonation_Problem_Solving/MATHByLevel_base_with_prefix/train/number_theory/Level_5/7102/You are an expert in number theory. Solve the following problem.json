For a positive integer $n$ and nonzero digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, let $A_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $a$; let $B_n$ be the $n$-digit integer each of whose digits is equal to $b$, and let $C_n$ be the $2n$-digit (not $n$-digit) integer each of whose digits is equal to $c$. What is the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 12} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 14} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 16} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 18} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 20}$\n",
    "solution": "Observe $A_n = a(1 + 10 + \\dots + 10^{n - 1}) = a \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$; similarly $B_n = b \\cdot \\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ and $C_n = c \\cdot \\tfrac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}$. The relation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ rewrites as\\[c \\cdot \\frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} - b \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9} = a^2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\\right)^2.\\]Since $n > 0$, $10^n > 1$ and we may cancel out a factor of $\\tfrac{10^n - 1}{9}$ to obtain\\[c \\cdot (10^n + 1) - b = a^2 \\cdot \\frac{10^n - 1}{9}.\\]This is a linear equation in $10^n$. Thus, if two distinct values of $n$ satisfy it, then all values of $n$ will. Now we plug in $n=0$ and $n=1$ (or some other number), we get $2c - b = 0$ and $11c - b= a^2$ . Solving the equations for $c$ and $b$, we get\\[c = \\frac{a^2}{9} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c - b = -\\frac{a^2}{9} \\implies b = \\frac{2a^2}{9}.\\]To maximize $a + b + c = a + \\tfrac{a^2}{3}$, we need to maximize $a$. Since $b$ and $c$ must be integers, $a$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a = 9$ then $b$ exceeds $9$. However, if $a = 6$ then $b = 8$ and $c = 4$ for an answer of $\\boxed{18}$.",

If $1-a^2$ is not $0$, then this means 10 does not divide it, meaning there is a unique $n$ that works for this case, namely $\\frac {\\log {b-a^2}}{\\log{1-a^2}}$ must be an integer.
