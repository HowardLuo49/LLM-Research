    "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits, we must first consider the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 3.\n\nSince we know that the number has 23 as its last two digits, the possible values for the first two digits must be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Since we are looking for four-digit numbers, the first digit cannot be 0.\n\nLet us consider each case where the sum of the four digits is divisible by 3:\n\nCase 1: First digit is 1\nThe last three digits must add up to a multiple of 3. Since the last two digits are fixed as 23, the third digit can be 1 to 7. So, we have 7 choices for the third digit. The first digit is fixed as 1. Thus, there is only 1 such number.\n\nCase 2: First digit is 2\nThe last three digits must add up to a multiple of 3. Since the last two digits are fixed as 23, the third digit can be 0 to 8. So, we have 9 choices for the third digit. The first digit is fixed as 2. Thus, there is only 1 such number.\n\nSimilarly, we can analyze the remaining cases where the first digit is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. \n\nThus, the total number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits is the sum of the number of such numbers in each case:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits.",
