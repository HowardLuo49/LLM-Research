    "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.",
