From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).",
    "gpt_response": "As a mathematician with a PhD, I will approach this problem by systematically analyzing the possible values of $z$. \n\nFirst, let's consider the range of values for $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are both integers between 100 and 999 inclusive, the possible values for $x$ range from 100 to 999, and the possible values for $y$ range from 100 to 999 as well (since $y$ is formed by reversing the digits of $x$).\n\nNext, let's consider the possible values for $z$. Since $z = |x-y|$, we can see that $z$ will always be a non-negative integer. Moreover, since $x$ and $y$ are between 100 and 999 and $y$ is formed by reversing the digits of $x$, the maximum possible value for $z$ would occur when $x = 999$ and $y = 999$, resulting in $z = |999-999| = 0$. \n\nTherefore, the distinct values of $z$ that are possible range from 0 to the maximum possible value. To determine the number of distinct values of $z$, we simply need to count the number of non-negative integers between 0 and the maximum possible value (which is 0 in this case).\n\nThus, there is only one distinct value of $z$ that is possible in this scenario, which is 0.",
