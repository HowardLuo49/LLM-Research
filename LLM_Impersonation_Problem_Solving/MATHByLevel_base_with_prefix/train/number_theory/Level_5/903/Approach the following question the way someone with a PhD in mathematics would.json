    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the largest number that is certain to divide $P$, we can analyze the prime factorization of each number on the six-sided die.\n\nThe prime factorization of each number on a standard six-sided die is as follows:\n1 = 1 \n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n\nThus, the product $P$ of the five numbers that are visible after rolling the die will be a multiple of 2, 3, and 5, as these numbers appear in the prime factorization of each number on the die.\n\nTherefore, the largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is the product of 2, 3, and 5, which is $2 * 3 * 5 = 30$. This number is certain to divide $P$ because it includes all the prime factors present in the numbers on the die.",
