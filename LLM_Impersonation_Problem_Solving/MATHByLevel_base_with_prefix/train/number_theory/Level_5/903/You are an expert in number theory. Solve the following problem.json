    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "gpt_response": "The largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is $6$. \n\nTo see why this is the case, consider the possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The numbers that are visible are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, $ and $6$. The product of these numbers, $P$, can be written as $P = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 720$. \n\nSince $720$ is divisible by $6$, it is certain that $6$ will divide $P$. Additionally, $720$ is not necessarily divisible by any number larger than $6$ that could appear on a standard six-sided die, so $6$ is the largest number that is certain to divide $P.",
