    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n",
    "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $N$ be the number of rows in the triangular array. Since the top row has $50$ elements, the total number of elements in the triangular array is $\\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$.\n\nLet's consider the multiples of $67$. Starting from the top row, the sum of two consecutive numbers in the first row is not divisible by $67$. For the second row, each number is the sum of two consecutive numbers in the first row, and since the first row consists of odd integers, there are no multiples of $67$ in the second row. This reasoning can be extended to all rows in the triangular array.\n\nSince $67$ is prime, there are no multiples of $67$ in the array. Thus, the number of entries in the array that are multiples of $67$ is $\\boxed{0}$.",
