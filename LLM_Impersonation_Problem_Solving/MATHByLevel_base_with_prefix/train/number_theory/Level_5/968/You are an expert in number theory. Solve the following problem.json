    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that a natural number $n$ has a certain number of factors if it can be expressed in the form $n = p_{1}^{k_{1}} \\cdot p_{2}^{k_{2}} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_{n}^{k_{n}}$, where $p_{1}, p_{2}, ..., p_{n}$ are prime numbers and $k_{1}, k_{2}, ..., k_{n}$ are positive integers. The number of factors of $n$ is then given by $(k_{1} + 1) \\cdot (k_{2} + 1) \\cdot ... \\cdot (k_{n} + 1)$.\n\nSince $x$, $y$, and $z$ each have exactly three factors, we can express them as $x = p_{1}^{2}$, $y = p_{2}^{2}$, $z = p_{3}^{2}$, where $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, and $p_{3}$ are distinct prime numbers. \n\nSubstituting these values into $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4} = p_{1}^{4} \\cdot p_{2}^{6} \\cdot p_{3}^{8}$, we see that the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is $(4+1) \\cdot (6+1) \\cdot (8+1) = 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{315}$.",
