Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?",
    "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.",

Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we must have $n \\leq m$.\n\nNow, the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ is given by:\n$$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = p_1^{max(e_1, f_1)} \\cdot p_2^{max(e_2, f_2)} \\cdots p_n^{max(e_n, f_n)} \\cdot q_1^{max(e_1, f_1)} \\cdots q_m^{max(e_m, f_m)}$$\n\nSince $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes, we have that $n+m-7 \\geq 28$.
