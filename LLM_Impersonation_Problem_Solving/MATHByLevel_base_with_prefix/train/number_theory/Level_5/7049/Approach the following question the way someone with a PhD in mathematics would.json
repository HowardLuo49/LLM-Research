    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of 8, no two of whose digits are the same. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000?\n",
    "solution": "We want a number with no digits repeating, so we can only use the digits 0-9 once in constructing our number. To make the greatest number, we want the greatest digit to occupy the leftmost side and the least digit to occupy the rightmost side. Therefore, the last three digits of the greatest number should be an arrangement of the digits $0,1,2$. Since the number has to be divisible by 8, the integer formed by the arrangement of $0,1,2$ is also divisible by 8. The only arrangement that works is $120$.\nTherefore, the remainder when the number is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest integer multiple of 8 with no repeating digits, we must consider the possible digits that can be used in each place value. Since the number must be a multiple of 8, we can start by considering the last 3 digits of the number to ensure divisibility by 8.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 8, the number formed by its last 3 digits must be divisible by 8. We can list down all the possible permutations of 3 different digits to find a number that is divisible by 8. These include numbers such as 136, 168, 712, etc. \n\nHowever, we need to find the greatest number possible, so we should consider the highest possible digit for each place value. This leads us to the number 984, which is the highest 3-digit number with distinct digits that is divisible by 8.\n\nTherefore, the largest multiple of 8 with distinct digits is 984.\n\nTo find the remainder when 984 is divided by 1000, we simply need to subtract 1000 from 984 to get the remainder. So, the remainder when N is divided by 1000 is 984.",
