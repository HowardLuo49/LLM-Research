    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the day of the week on which Lucy's party was held, we will first calculate the day of the week on which Lucy's $1000$th day of life falls.\n\nWe know that there are $365$ days in a year, so Lucy's $1000$th day of life is $(1000 \\div 365) = 2$ years, $($1000 \\mod 365) = 270$ days after her birth.\n\nSince $2004$ was a leap year, Lucy's $1000$th day of life falls on $2$ years and $270$ days after December 1st, 2004. Counting the number of leap years from 2004 to 2006, we find that only $2004$ is a leap year. Therefore, there is a total of $366$ days in these $2$ years.\n\nAdding $270$ days to the $366$ days, we get a total of $636$ days. This means Lucy's $1000$th day of life is $1000$ - $636$ = $364$ days after December 1st, 2006. This falls exactly on Sunday.\n\nTherefore, Lucy's party was held on a $\\boxed{\\text{Sunday}}$.",
