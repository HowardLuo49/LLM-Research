    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Lucy was born on Wednesday, December 1st, 2004. That Wednesday was the first day of her life. Her parents held a party for her on the $1000$th day of her life. On which day of the week was the party?",
    "solution": "Since there are 7 days in a week, Lucy's 1st day, 8th day, 15th day, 22nd day, etc. were on Wednesday. When $1000$ is divided by $7$, the remainder is $6$. Therefore, the 1002nd day was a Wednesday (since 1002 is one more than a multiple of 7).  So the 1000th day, was two days earlier on a $\\boxed{\\text{Monday}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine on which day of the week Lucy's party was held, we need to calculate the day of the week for the $1000$th day of her life after her birth.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the day of the week Lucy was born on December $1$, $2004$. To do this, we can use Zeller's Congruence formula, which gives us the following result:\n\n\\[q = 1, \\ m = 11, \\ Y = 2004, \\ K = 4, \\ X = 0\\]\n\n\\[h = \\left(q + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13(m+1)}{5} \\right\\rfloor + K + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{K}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{Y}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2Y \\right) \\mod 7\\]\n\nPlugging the values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[h = (1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{13*12}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 4 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{4}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2004}{4} \\right\\rfloor - 2*2004) \\mod 7\\]\n\n\\[h = (1 + 30 + 4 + 1 + 501 - 4008) \\mod 7\\]\n\n\\[h = - 2471 \\mod 7\\]\n\n\\[h = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, Lucy was born on a Wednesday.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the day of the week for the $1000$th day after her birth. Since $1000$ is divisible by $7$ with remainder $1$, we can conclude that the $1000$th day after Lucy's birth is also a Wednesday.\n\nThus, Lucy's parents held the party for her on a Wednesday, which was the $1000$th day of her life.",
