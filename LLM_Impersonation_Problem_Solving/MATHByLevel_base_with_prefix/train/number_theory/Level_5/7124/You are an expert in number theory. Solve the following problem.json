    "solution": "If $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = m^2$, we can complete the square on the left-hand side to get $n^2 + 12n + 36 = m^2 + 2043$ so $(n+6)^2 = m^2 + 2043$. Subtracting $m^2$ and factoring the left-hand side, we get $(n + m + 6)(n - m + 6) = 2043$. $2043 = 3^2 \\cdot 227$, which can be split into two factors in 3 ways, $2043 \\cdot 1 = 3 \\cdot 681 = 227 \\cdot 9$. This gives us three pairs of equations to solve for $n$:\n$n + m + 6 = 2043$ and $n - m + 6 = 1$ give $2n + 12 = 2044$ and $n = 1016$.\n$n + m + 6 = 681$ and $n - m + 6 = 3$ give $2n + 12 = 684$ and $n = 336$.\n$n + m + 6 = 227$ and $n - m + 6 = 9$ give $2n + 12 = 236$ and $n = 112$.\nFinally, $1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464$, so the answer is $\\boxed{464}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We can rewrite the given expression as $n^2 + 12n - 2007 = k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer. By completing the square, we have $(n+6)^2 - 2007 - 36 = k^2$, which simplifies to $(n+6)^2 - k^2 = 2043$. \n\nSince $2043 = 3 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 29$, we can factorize it as $2043 = 3 \\cdot 59 - 29 \\cdot 23$. Thus, we have the system of equations:\n\n$(n+6+k)(n+6-k) = 3 \\cdot 59$\n\n$(n+6+k)-(n+6-k) = 29$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we get $n = 468, 1080$ as the possible values of $n$. Therefore, $S = 468 + 1080 = 1548$.\n\nThus, the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$ is $\\boxed{548}$.",
