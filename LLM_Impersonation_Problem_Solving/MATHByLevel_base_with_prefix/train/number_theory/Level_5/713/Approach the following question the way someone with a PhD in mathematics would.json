    "solution": "We start by generating powers of 9 modulo 17. Note that we can generate $9^{2k}$ from $9^k$ by squaring $9^k$. We get \\begin{align*}\n9^1 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^2 &\\equiv 13 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^4 &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{17} \\\\\n9^8 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}.\n\\end{align*}Since $9^8 \\equiv 1$ modulo 17, we have \\begin{align*}\n9^{2010} &\\equiv 9^2 9^{2008} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 (9^8)^{251} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 1^{251} \\\\\n&\\equiv 9^2 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{13} \\pmod{17}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "gpt_response": "To find the residue of $9^{2010}$ modulo 17, we can use Euler's totient theorem. Since 17 is a prime number, the totient function $\\phi(17)$ will equal $17-1=16$. \n\nBy Euler's totient theorem, we know that $9^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$. Therefore, we can rewrite $9^{2010}$ as $(9^{16})^{125}9^{10} \\equiv 1^{125}9^{10} \\pmod{17}$.\n\nWe then need to calculate $9^{10} \\equiv 3^{20} \\pmod{17}$. By repeatedly squaring 3, we find that $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{17}$, $3^4 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$, $3^8 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{17}$, and finally $3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{17}$.\n\nTherefore, $3^{20} \\equiv 3^4 \\pmod{17}$, which gives us $3^{20} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{17}$.\n\nThus, the residue of $9^{2010}$ modulo 17 is $\\boxed{13}$.",
