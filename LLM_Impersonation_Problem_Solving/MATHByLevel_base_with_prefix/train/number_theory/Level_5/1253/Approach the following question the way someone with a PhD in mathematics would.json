    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?",
    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number with all different digits that add up to 16, we can start by considering the pattern of digits that would maximize the value of the number. Since we want the digits to be different, we should start with the largest possible digit, which is 9.\n\nWe can then continue filling in the digits in descending order, ensuring that each digit is different. Since the sum of the digits is 16, we can deduce that the largest possible digit in this case would be 9, followed by 7, and then 0 (since it is not mentioned that 0 is not allowed in the number).\n\nTherefore, the largest number with all different digits that add up to 16 is 970.",
