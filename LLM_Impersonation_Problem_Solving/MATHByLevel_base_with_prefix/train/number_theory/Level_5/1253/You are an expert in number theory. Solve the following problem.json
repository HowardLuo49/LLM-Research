    "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest number with its digits all different that adds up to 16, we need to start with the largest possible digits.\n\nSince the digits must all be different, we start with the largest digit, which is 9. Next, we fill in the remaining digits in descending order. We continue this process until we have used up the digit sum of 16.\n\nStarting from 9, we can have 9 + 7 = 16, which gives us 97 as the largest number with its digits all different that adds up to 16.",
