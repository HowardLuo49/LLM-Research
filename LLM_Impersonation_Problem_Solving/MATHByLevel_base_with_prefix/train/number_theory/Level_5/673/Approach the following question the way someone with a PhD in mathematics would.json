    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ have?",
    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "Firstly, we note that the positive divisors of $400$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200,$ and $400$. The sum of these divisors can be calculated by adding them all up:\n\n$1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 + 16 + 20 + 25 + 40 + 50 + 80 + 100 + 200 + 400 = 931$.\n\nNext, we need to find the distinct prime factors of 931. We can do this by prime factorizing 931 as follows:\n\n$931 = 1 \\times 931 = 7 \\times 133 = 47 \\times 19$.\n\nTherefore, the distinct prime factors of the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ (which is 931) are $47$ and $19$. So, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ has two distinct prime factors.",
