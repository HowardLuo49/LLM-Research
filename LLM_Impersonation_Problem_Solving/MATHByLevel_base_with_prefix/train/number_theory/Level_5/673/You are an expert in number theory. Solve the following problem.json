    "solution": "First, we find what the sum of the divisors of $400$ is.\n\nThe prime factorization of $400$ is $2^4 \\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the sum of the divisors is $(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = 31 \\cdot 31$. To see why the expression on the left-hand side gives the sum of the divisors of 400, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 15 terms, each divisor of $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ appearing exactly once.\n\nSince $31$ is a prime number, the sum of the positive divisors of $400$ only has $\\boxed{1}$ prime factor.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of distinct prime factors of the sum of the positive divisors of 400, we first need to find the sum of the divisors of 400.\n\n$400 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2$\n\nThe sum of the divisors of 400 can be found using the formula:\n$$(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4)(1+5+5^2) = (31)(31) = 961$$\n\nNow, we need to find the prime factors of 961.\n\n$961 = 31^2$\n\nSo, the sum of the divisors of 400 has only one distinct prime factor, which is 31.",
