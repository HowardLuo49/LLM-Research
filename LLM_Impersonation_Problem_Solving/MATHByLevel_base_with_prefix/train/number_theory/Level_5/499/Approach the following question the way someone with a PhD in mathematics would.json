    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Mady has an infinite number of balls and empty boxes available to her. The empty boxes, each capable of holding four balls, are arranged in a row from left to right. At the first step, she places a ball in the first box (the leftmost box) of the row. At each subsequent step, she places a ball in the first box of the row that still has room for a ball and empties any boxes to its left. How many balls in total are in the boxes as a result of Mady's $2010$th step?",
    "solution": "After trying the first few steps, we notice that the boxes resemble the set of positive integers in quinary (base $5$). In particular, the first box corresponds to the units digit, the second corresponds to the fives digit, and so forth. An empty box corresponds to the digit $0$ and a box with $k$ balls, $1 \\le k \\le 4$ corresponds to the digit $k$.\n\nWe need to verify that this is true. On the first step, the boxes represent the number $1$. For the $n$th step, suppose that the units digit of $n$ in quinary is not equal to $4$, so that the first box is not full. The operation of adding $1$ in quinary simply increments the units digit of $n$ by $1$. Indeed, Mady performs the corresponding operation by adding a ball to the first box. Otherwise, if the units digit of $n$ in quinary is equal to $4$, suppose that the rightmost $m$ consecutive quinary digits of $n$ are equal to $4$. Then, adding $1$ to $n$ entails carrying over multiple times, so that the $m+1$th digit will be incremented once and the other $m$ digits will become zero. Mady does the same: she places a ball in the first available box (the $m+1$th), and empties all of the previous boxes.\n\nIt follows that the number of filled boxes on the $2010$th step is just the sum of the digits in the quinary expression for $2010$. Converting this to quinary, the largest power of $5$ less than $2010$ is $5^{4} = 625$, and that $3 < 2010/625 < 4$. Then, $2010 - 3 \\cdot 625 = 135$. Repeating this step, we find that $$2010 = 3 \\cdot 5^{4} + 1 \\cdot 5^3 + 2 \\cdot 5^1,$$ so the desired answer is $3 + 1 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nAt step $1$, Mady places a ball in the first box. The total number of balls in the boxes is $1$.\n\nAt step $2$, Mady places a ball in the second box since the first box is now full. The total number of balls in the boxes is $2$.\n\nAt step $3$, Mady places a ball in the third box since the second box is now full. The total number of balls in the boxes is $3$.\n\nAt step $4$, Mady places a ball in the fourth box since the third box is now full. The total number of balls in the boxes is $4$.\n\nAt step $5$, Mady places a ball in the first box as the fourth box is full and she starts from the left again. The first box now has $2$ balls, the second has $1$ ball, and the third and fourth boxes are empty. The total number of balls in the boxes is $3$.\n\nAt step $6$, Mady places a ball in the second box. The first box now has $2$ balls, the second has $2$ balls, and the third and fourth boxes are empty. The total number of balls in the boxes is $4$.\n\nThis pattern continues in the following manner:\n\nStep $7$: $1+2+1=4$ balls\nStep $8$: $2+1+1=4$ balls\nStep $9$: $2+2=4$ balls\nStep $10$: $2+2=4$ balls\n\nFrom the pattern above, we can conclude that at every $4$th step, there will be $4$ balls in total in the boxes. Since $2010$ is divisible by $4$, at step $2010$, there will also be $4$ balls in total in the boxes.\n\nTherefore, Mady's $2010$th step will result in a total of $\\boxed{4}$ balls in the boxes.",
