    "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the least positive integer value of $n$ such that $n^2-n$ is divisible by some, but not all, integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$, we must first consider the factors of $n^2-n$. \n\nFactorizing the expression $n^2-n$ gives $n(n-1)$. In order for $n^2-n$ to be divisible by a positive integer $k$, $n(n-1)$ must be divisible by that integer $k$. \n\nThis means that the factors of $n$ and $n-1$ must include every possible factor of $k$ in order for $n(n-1)$ to be divisible by $k$. \n\nHowever, if $n$ and $n-1$ are not relatively prime, there will be some integer values of $k$ for which $n^2-n$ is not divisible. \n\nThe smallest such $n$ that satisfies this condition is when $n=2$. Here we see that $n=2$ and $n-1=1$ are relatively prime, meaning that for $k=2$, $n^2-n=2$ is not divisible by $k=2$. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$ is $n=2$.",
