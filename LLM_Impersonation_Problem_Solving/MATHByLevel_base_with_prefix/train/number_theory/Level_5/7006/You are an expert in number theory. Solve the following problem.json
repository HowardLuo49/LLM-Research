    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "We want to find the largest positive integer $n$ such that $n^3 + 100$ is divisible by $n+10$.\n\nSince $n+10$ divides $n^3 + 100$, we know that $n^3 + 100 = k(n+10)$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we get $n^3 - kn + 100 - 10k = 0$. \n\nBy the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of this polynomial must divide the constant term $100-10k$. Since we are looking for the largest value of $n$, we want to find the largest factor of $100-10k$ that is also a factor of $n^3 - kn$.\n\nTrying some values of $k$, we find that $k = 10$ gives us $n=90$ as the largest solution. \n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3 + 100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is $\\boxed{90}$.",
