    "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3 + 100$ is divisible by $n+10$, we can use synthetic division or polynomial long division. \n\nLet $f(n) = n^3 + 100$. We want to find the remainder when $f(n)$ is divided by $n+10$. \n\nUsing polynomial long division or synthetic division, we have:\n\n$n^2 - 10n + 100$\n$---------------$\n$n + 10 | n^3 + 0n^2 + 0n + 100$\n$------- (n^3 + 10n^2)$\n$-----------(-10n^2 + 0n)$\n$-------------(-10n^2 - 100n)$\n$--------------- (100n + 100)$\n$------------------(-100n + 100)$\n$--------------------0$\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $0$, which means $n+10$ divides evenly into $n^3 + 100$.\n\nSo, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is when $n = 10$, as $10+10=20$ divides evenly into $10^3+100=1100$.",
