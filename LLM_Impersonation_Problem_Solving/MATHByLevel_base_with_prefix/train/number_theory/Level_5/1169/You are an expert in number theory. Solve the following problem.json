    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the oddly powerful integers less than 2010, we need to find all numbers that can be expressed as $a^b$ where $a$ and $b$ satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, note that $a$ must be a perfect $b$th power, because $b$ is odd. We can therefore find all $b$th powers less than 2010 and count how many of them are odd.\n\nLet's consider $b=3$, for example. The largest $b$th power less than 2010 is $12^3 = 1728$. Similarly, the largest $5$th power less than 2010 is $4^5=1024$, and the largest $7$th power less than 2010 is $3^7=2187$.\n\nCombining these results, we have that all oddly powerful integers less than 2010 are given by the set $\\{2^3,3^3,2^5,3^5,2^7\\} = \\{8,27,32,243,128\\}$. There are $5$ oddly powerful integers less than 2010.",
