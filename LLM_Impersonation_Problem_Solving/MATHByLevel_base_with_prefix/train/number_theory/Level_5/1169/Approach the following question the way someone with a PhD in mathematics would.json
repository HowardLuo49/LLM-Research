    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?",
    "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of oddly powerful integers less than $2010$, we first need to determine the possible values of $a$ and $b$ for each integer less than $2010$ that satisfies the condition $a^b = n$. \n\nLet's first consider the case where $b$ is odd. Since $b$ is odd, $a$ must also be odd in order for $a^b$ to be odd. Therefore, for each odd integer $b>1$, there are infinitely many possible odd values for $a$ such that $a^b$ is an oddly powerful integer. \n\nNext, we consider the case where $b$ is even. If $b$ is even, then $a$ must also be even in order for $a^b$ to be an integer. Therefore, there are no oddly powerful integers of the form $a^b$ where $b$ is even.\n\nNow, we need to determine the maximum value of $b$ such that $a^b <2010$ for any given $a$. Since $a$ has to be odd in order for $n$ to be oddly powerful, we can consider the case where $a=1$ and $a=3$ to find the maximum value of $b$ for each $a$:\n\nFor $a=1$, the maximum value of $b$ such that $1^b <2010$ is $b=10$.\n\nFor $a=3$, the maximum value of $b$ such that $3^b <2010$ is $b=6$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all oddly powerful integers less than $2010$ can be expressed as the set $\\{1^3, 1^5, 1^7, 1^9, 3^3, 3^5\\}$. Thus, there are a total of $\\boxed{6}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.",
