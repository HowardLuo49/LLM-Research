Let $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.\n\n(Here $n!$ denotes $1\\times\\cdots\\times n$ for each positive integer $n$.)",
    "solution": "We compute that $4!=1\\times 2\\times 3\\times 4 = 2^{3}\\times 3=24$.
