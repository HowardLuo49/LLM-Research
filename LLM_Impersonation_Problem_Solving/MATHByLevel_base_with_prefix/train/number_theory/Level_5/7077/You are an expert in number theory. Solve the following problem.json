    "solution": "In base $3$, we find that $\\overline{2008}_{10} = \\overline{2202101}_{3}$. In other words,\n$2008 = 2 \\cdot 3^{6} + 2 \\cdot 3^{5} + 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 \\cdot 3^0$\nIn order to rewrite as a sum of perfect powers of $3$, we can use the fact that $2 \\cdot 3^k = 3^{k+1} - 3^k$:\n$2008 = (3^7 - 3^6) + (3^6-3^5) + (3^4 - 3^3) + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0$\nThe answer is $7+5+4+3+2+0 = \\boxed{21}$.\nNote: Solution by bounding is also possible, namely using the fact that $1+3+3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{n} = \\displaystyle\\frac{3^{n+1}-1}{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "We first note that $3^{n_i}$ is always odd, so the sum of odd numbers is always odd. Therefore, in order to get a sum of 2008, the number of terms in our sum must be even. \n\nWe start by noticing that $3^6 = 729 < 2008 < 3^7 = 2187$, so $n_1 < 7$. Since each term has a coefficient of $1$ or $-1$, the maximum sum we can achieve with $n_1 = 6$ is $3^6 - 2 \\cdot 3^5 + 3^4 - 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 3^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 = 1962$. Thus, we must have $n_1 = 5$. \n\nAt this point, we can write our equation as $a_1 \\cdot 243 + a_2 \\cdot 81 + a_3 \\cdot 27 + a_4 \\cdot 9 + a_5 \\cdot 3 = 2008$. From here, we see that $a_1$ must be $1$, because otherwise, the largest sum we could get is $162 + 54 + 18 + 6 + 3 = 243 < 2008$. \n\nAt this point, our equation simplifies to $243 + a_2 \\cdot 81 + a_3 \\cdot 27 + a_4 \\cdot 9 + a_5 \\cdot 3 = 2008 - 243 = 1765$. Dividing by $3$, $81$, $27$, $9$, we see that each of $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$, $a_5$ must equal $-1$. Thus, our final list becomes $5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.",
