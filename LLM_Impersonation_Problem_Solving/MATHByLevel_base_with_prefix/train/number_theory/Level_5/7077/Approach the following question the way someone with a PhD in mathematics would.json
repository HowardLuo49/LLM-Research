There exist $r$ unique nonnegative integers $n_1 > n_2 > \\cdots > n_r$ and $r$ unique integers $a_k$ ($1\\le k\\le r$) with each $a_k$ either $1$ or $- 1$ such that\\[a_13^{n_1} + a_23^{n_2} + \\cdots + a_r3^{n_r} = 2008.\\]Find $n_1 + n_2 + \\cdots + n_r$.\n",
    "solution": "In base $3$, we find that $\\overline{2008}_{10} = \\overline{2202101}_{3}$. In other words,\n$2008 = 2 \\cdot 3^{6} + 2 \\cdot 3^{5} + 2 \\cdot 3^3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 + 1 \\cdot 3^0$\nIn order to rewrite as a sum of perfect powers of $3$, we can use the fact that $2 \\cdot 3^k = 3^{k+1} - 3^k$:\n$2008 = (3^7 - 3^6) + (3^6-3^5) + (3^4 - 3^3) + 3^2 + 3^0 = 3^7 - 3^5 + 3^4 - 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^0$\nThe answer is $7+5+4+3+2+0 = \\boxed{21}$.\nNote: Solution by bounding is also possible, namely using the fact that $1+3+3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{n} = \\displaystyle\\frac{3^{n+1}-1}{2}.$",
    "gpt_response": "This problem can be approached by considering the given equation and breaking it down into its binary representation.
