    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the four consecutive digits of the positive integer $n$ be $a, a-1, a-2,$ and $a-3$. \nTherefore, $n = 1000a + 100(a-1) + 10(a-2) + (a-3) = 1111a - 123$.\n\nWe want to find the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$, which is equivalent to finding the possible remainders when $1111a$ is divided by $37$.\n\nNote that $1111 \\equiv 25 \\pmod{37}$. \nTherefore, $1111a \\equiv 25a \\pmod{37}$.\n\nSince $25$ is relatively prime to $37$ (since $\\gcd(25,37) = 1$), we can conclude that $a$ can take on any residue modulo $37$. \nSo, the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ are $\\boxed{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 36}$, and the sum of these is $\\frac{36 \\cdot 37}{2} = \\boxed{666}$.",
