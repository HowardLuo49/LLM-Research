    "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first represent the positive integer $n$ in terms of its digits. Let the digits of $n$ be $a$, $a-1$, $a-2$, and $a-3$, where $a$ is the largest digit. Therefore, $n$ can be expressed as\n\n$n = 1000a + 100(a-1) + 10(a-2) + (a-3) = 1111a - 321$.\n\nWe are looking for the remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$. We know that $1111 = 30 \\times 37 + 1$. Hence, \n\n$n \\equiv 1111a - 321 \\equiv a - 321 \\equiv a + 16 \\pmod{37}$.\n\nThus, the remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ will range from $16$ to $19$ inclusive, depending on the value of $a$. To find the sum of these remainders, we take the average of this range:\n\n$\\frac{16 + 17 + 18 + 19}{4} = 17.5$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ is $17.5$, which can be written as $\\boxed{35}$.",
