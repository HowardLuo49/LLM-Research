    "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest positive multiple of $15$ with every digit being either $8$ or $0$, we need to construct the number starting from the leftmost digit.\n\nSince $15$ is divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits of $n$ must also be divisible by $3$ for $n$ to be divisible by $15$. The only choice we have for the digits of $n$ are $8$ and $0$. Since each $8$ is a multiple of $3$, we need to determine how many $8$'s we can have without going overboard.\n\nIf we have $4$ or more $8$'s, then the sum of the digits of $n$ will be greater than $12$, which is not permissible since it will not be divisible by $3$. Therefore, we can have at most $3$ $8$'s in the number.\n\nSo, the largest number we can construct is $8880$ which is divisible by $15$. Therefore, $n=8880$ and $\\frac{n}{15}=592$.",
