    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$, we first note that $2019^8+1$ is a sum of squares of a number and 1. We can rewrite it as $(2019^4+1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 2019^4$. \n\nNext, we can use the Sophie Germain identity, which states that $a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab)(a^2 + 2b^2 - 2ab)$. In this case, $a = 2019$ and $b=1$, so we have $2019^4 + 4 \\cdot 1^4 = (2019^2 + 2 \\cdot 1^2 + 2 \\cdot 2019 \\cdot 1)(2019^2 + 2 \\cdot 1^2 - 2 \\cdot 2019 \\cdot 1)$. Simplifying this gives $2019^4 + 4 = (2019^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 2019)(2019^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 2019)$.\n\nTherefore, we have that $2019^8 + 1 = (2019^4 + 1)^2 - 2 \\cdot 2019^4 = ((2019^2 + 2 + 2 \\cdot 2019)(2019^2 + 2 - 2 \\cdot 2019)) - 2 \\cdot 2019^4 = (2020 \\cdot 2017)(2017) - 2 \\cdot 2019^4$.\n\nConsidering the expression $(2020 \\cdot 2017)(2017) - 2 \\cdot 2019^4$, we observe that $2017$, which is a prime number, is a factor of $2019^8 + 1$. Therefore, the least odd prime factor of $2019^8 + 1$ is $\\boxed{2017}$.",
