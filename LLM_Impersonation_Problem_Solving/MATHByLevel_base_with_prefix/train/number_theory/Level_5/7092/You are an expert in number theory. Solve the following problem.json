    "solution": "We know that $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$.\nSince $2019^{16} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.\nHowever, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \\pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\\equiv -1\\pmod{p}$.\nTherefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\\phi(p)$, we see that $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\\phi(p) = p\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{p}\\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. As $2019^8 \\not\\equiv -1 \\pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\\boxed{97}$.",
