Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n",
    "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the positive integers that are not factorial tails, we need to understand the relationship between a factorial and its ending zeroes. \n\nA factorial of a number $m$, denoted by $m!$, is equal to the product of all positive integers up to $m$. The number of trailing zeroes in the decimal representation of $m!$ is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $m!$, as there are always more factors of 2 than 5. This is because there are more factors of 2 in the sequence of positive integers than factors of 5. \n\nTo find the number of trailing zeroes in $m!$, we need to count how many times 5 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of each number up to $m$. This can be done by dividing $m$ by powers of 5 and summing the results. \n\nIf the number of trailing zeroes in $m!$ is $n$, then there must be $n$ factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $m!$. Therefore, we are looking for positive integers $m$ such that the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $m!$ is not equal to $n$. \n\nIn this case, we are asked to find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails. To do this, we can consider the number of trailing zeroes for each $m$ up to $1992$ and count how many different values of trailing zeroes we encounter. \n\nThis analysis requires knowledge of number theory, specifically the prime factorization of factorials and their relationship to trailing zeroes.
