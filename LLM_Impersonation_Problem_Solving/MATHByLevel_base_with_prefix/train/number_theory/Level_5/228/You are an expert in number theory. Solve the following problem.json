    "solution": "The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\\cdot1+802\\cdot9+401\\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \\boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.",

To find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd positive integers, we need to consider the units digit of each individual square and then sum them up.\n\nThe units digit of the square of an odd number is always either 1, 5, 9, or 5. \n\nThe first odd number is 1, which has a square of 1 (units digit is 1).\nThe second odd number is 3, which has a square of 9 (units digit is 9).\nThe third odd number is 5, which has a square of 25 (units digit is 5).\nThe fourth odd number is 7, which has a square of 49 (units digit is 9).\nAnd so on...\n\nIn general, every odd number k has a square with a units digit of k squared modulo 10 (k^2 mod 10).
