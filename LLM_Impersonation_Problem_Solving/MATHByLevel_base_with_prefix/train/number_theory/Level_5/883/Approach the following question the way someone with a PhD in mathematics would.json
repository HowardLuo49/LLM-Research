    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "We start by analyzing the fraction $\\frac{n}{1400}$. In order for its decimal representation to terminate, the denominator must be of the form $2^m5^m$ for some non-negative integer $m$. \n\nThe prime factorization of 1400 is $2^3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$. In order for $\\frac{n}{1400}$ to have a terminating decimal representation, we need to get rid of the factor of 7 in the denominator. This means that $n$ must be divisible by the highest power of 7 that appears in the prime factorization of 1400, which is $7^1$. \n\nTherefore, $n$ must be of the form $7k$ for some integer $k$. Since $n$ must be between 1 and 1000, we need to find the number of integers between 1 and 1000 that are divisible by 7. \n\nThe first integer greater than 1000 that is divisible by 7 is $7 \\times 142 = 994$, and the last integer between 1 and 1000 that is divisible by 7 is $7 \\times 142 = 994$. So, there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers between 1 and 1000 for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminates.",
