    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "For the decimal representation of a fraction to terminate, the denominator must be of the form $2^m5^n$ where $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers. In this case, the denominator is 1400, which can be written as $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\n\nTherefore, in order for $\\frac{n}{1400}$ to have a terminating decimal representation, the prime factorization of $n$ must include only 2, 5, and 7.\n\nSince we are looking for values of $n$ between 1 and 1000, we consider integers of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot 7^c$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 3$, $0 \\leq b \\leq 2$, and $0 \\leq c \\leq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 choices for $a$, 3 choices for $b$, and 1 choice for $c$, so there are $4 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 12$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 inclusive such that the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminates.",
