    "solution": "Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.\nSince $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime. But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.\nThus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$. But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$. Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$. Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$. This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$. This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\\boxed{181}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the two consecutive cubes as $m^3$ and $(m+1)^3$, where $m$ is an integer. \n\nCondition (i) states that $n^2 = (m+1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$. This simplifies to $n^2 = 3m(m+1) + 1$. \n\nCondition (ii) states that $2n + 79 = k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. This can be rewritten as $2n = k^2 - 79$.\n\nWe can substitute $2n = k^2 - 79$ into the equation $n^2 = 3m(m+1) + 1$. This gives us $(k^2 - 79)^2 = 3m(m+1) + 1$. \n\nSolving these equations simultaneously would give us the largest integer $n$ satisfying the given conditions. This would involve finding an integer solution for $m$ and $k$ that satisfies the above equation. The largest integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions would then be determined. \n\nThe approach would involve algebraic manipulation and potentially number theory techniques to find the solution.
