    "solution": "Note that $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. We focus on the large prime $167$ as the powers of $2$ and $3$ in the prime factorization of $2004!$ are going to be much higher. The largest power of $167$ that divides $2004!$ is $\\tfrac{2004}{167} = \\boxed{12}$, the answer.",
    "gpt_response": "To compute the largest integer $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$, we need to determine the power of 2004 in the prime factorization of $2004!$.\n\nWe know that $2004!$ can be expressed as $2004 \\cdot 2003 \\cdot 2002 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1$. \n\nTo find the power of 2004 in the prime factorization of $2004!$, we need to count how many factors of 2004 are present in the product $2004!$. Since $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$, we need to count the number of times each prime factor of 2004 appears in the prime factorization of $2004!$. \n\nFor the prime factor 2, we need to count the number of factors of 2 in $2004!$. This can be determined by calculating the quotient when dividing 2004 by 2, then the quotient when dividing the result by 2 again until we reach a quotient less than 2. \n\n$2004 \\div 2 = 1002$\n$1002 \\div 2 = 501$\n$501 \\div 2 = 250$\n$250 \\div 2 = 125$\n$125 \\div 2 = 62$\n$62 \\div 2 = 31$\n\nSo, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of $2004!$ is $1002 + 501 + 250 + 125 + 62 + 31 = 1971$.\n\nSimilarly, for the prime factor 3, we need to calculate the number of factors of 3 in $2004!$.

Since 167 is a prime number, there is only one factor of 167 in $2004!$.\n\nTherefore, the power of 2004 in the prime factorization of $2004!$ is equal to the minimum of the powers of its prime factors, which is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$ to the power of $998$. \n\nHence, the largest integer $k$ such that $2004^k$ divides $2004!$ is $\\boxed{998}$.",
