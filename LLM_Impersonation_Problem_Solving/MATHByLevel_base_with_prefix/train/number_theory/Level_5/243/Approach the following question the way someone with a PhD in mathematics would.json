    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The sum of the positive divisors of a positive integer of the form $2^i3^j$ is equal to $600$. What is $i + j$?",
    "solution": "The sum of the divisors of $2^i3^j$ is equal to $(1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i-1} + 2^i)(1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j-1} + 3^j) = 600,$ since each factor of $2^i3^j$ is represented exactly once in the sum that results when the product is expanded. Let $A = 1+2^1 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{i}$ and $B = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + \\cdots + 3^{j}$, so that $A \\times B = 600$. The prime factorization of $600$ is $600 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nNotice that $A$ is the sum of $1$ and an even number and $B$ is the sum of $1$ and a number divisible by $3$. Thus, $A$ is odd and $B$ is not divisible by $3$. It follows that $A$ is divisible by $3$ and $B$ is divisible by $2^3$. We now have three separate cases: $(A,B) = (3 \\cdot 25,8), (3 \\cdot 5, 8 \\cdot 5), (3, 8 \\cdot 25)$.\n\nIn the first case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 8$; for $j = 1$, we have that $1 + 3 = 4 < 8$, and for $j = 2$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 = 13 > 8$. Thus, this case is not possible.\n\nFor the third case, $B = 1 + 3 + \\cdots + 3^{j} = 200$; for $j = 4$, then $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 < 200$, and for $j = 5$, we have that $1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364 > 200$. Thus, this case is also not possible.\n\nIt follows that $(A,B) = (15, 40)$, in which case we find that $i = j = 3$ works. Thus, the answer is $3 + 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to first understand the concept of divisors and how they relate to the prime factorization of a number. \n\nGiven a positive integer of the form $2^i3^j$, where $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers, the positive divisors of this number can be found by considering all possible combinations of powers of 2 and 3 up to the powers $i$ and $j$ respectively. The formula for finding the sum of divisors of a number in terms of its prime factorization is well-known and can be expressed as:\n\n$(1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^i)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^j)$\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can simplify the above expression to:\n\n$\\frac{2^{i+1} - 1}{2-1} \\cdot \\frac{3^{j+1} - 1}{3-1} = 600$\n\nSolving this equation will give us the values of $i$ and $j, and then $i + j$ can be determined.
