    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two-digit number be represented by AB, where A represents the tens digit and B represents the units digit. Let the three-digit number be represented by CDE, where C represents the hundreds digit, D represents the tens digit, and E represents the units digit.\n\nThus, the five-digit number formed by placing AB to the left of CDE can be represented as 100AB + CDE.\n\nThe product Sarah should have obtained is AB * CDE = (10A + B) * (100C + 10D + E) = 1000AC + 100AD + 10AE + 100BC + 10BD + BE.\n\nAccording to the given information, the five-digit number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. Therefore, we have the equation:\n\n100AB + CDE = 9(1000AC + 100AD + 10AE + 100BC + 10BD + BE)\n\nSimplifying this equation and expressing it in terms of A, B, C, D, and E gives:\n\n100AB + 1000AC + 100CDE = 9000AC + 900AD + 900AE + 900BC + 90BD + 9BE\n100AB + 1000AC + 100CDE = 9000AC + 900AD + 900AE + 900BC + 90BD + 9BE\n\nNow, we can express A, B, C, D, and E in terms of the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number:\n\nA = 10A + B\nB = 100C + 10D + E\n\nBy substituting these expressions into our equation, we can solve for the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number. This solution will require some algebraic manipulations and possibly factoring to simplify the equation and find the desired sum.",
