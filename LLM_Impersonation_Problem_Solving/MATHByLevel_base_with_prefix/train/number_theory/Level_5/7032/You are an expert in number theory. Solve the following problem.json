    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number. This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained. What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?\n",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the two-digit number, $y$ be the three-digit number. Putting together the given, we have $1000x+y=9xy \\Longrightarrow 9xy-1000x-y=0$. Using SFFT, this factorizes to $(9x-1)\\left(y-\\dfrac{1000}{9}\\right)=\\dfrac{1000}{9}$, and $(9x-1)(9y-1000)=1000$.\nSince $89 < 9x-1 < 890$, we can use trial and error on factors of 1000. If $9x - 1 = 100$, we get a non-integer. If $9x - 1 = 125$, we get $x=14$ and $y=112$, which satisifies the conditions. Hence the answer is $112 + 14 = \\boxed{126}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let the two-digit number be $ab$ and the three-digit number be $cde$. Therefore, the five-digit number will be $abcde$.\n\nAccording to the given conditions:\n$1000 \\cdot ab + cde = 9(ab \\cdot cde)$\n\nExpanding both sides gives:\n$1000ab + cde = 9000ab + 9cde$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$8000ab = 8cde$\n\nSince $ab$ is a two-digit number, we must have $cde > 100$ in order for this equation to hold true. Also, since $8000 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3$, we can see that $cde$ must be divisible by $2^4$ and $5^3$. The smallest number that fits this criterion and is larger than 100 is 800.\n\nTherefore, $cde = 800$ and $ab = 8$.\n\nThe sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number is $8 + 800 = 808$.",
