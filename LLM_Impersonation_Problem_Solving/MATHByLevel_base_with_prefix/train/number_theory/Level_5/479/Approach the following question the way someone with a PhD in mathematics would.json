    "solution": "Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\\ldots\\}$. We wish to determine the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$.\n\nNote that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\\pmod 5$. In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$. Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \\[\\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\}\\equiv \\{1,2,4,3,1,\\ldots\\}\\pmod 5.\\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period). Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$.\n\nNote that \\begin{align*}\n7&\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^7&\\equiv (-1)^7 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^{7^7}&\\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \\equiv 3\\pmod 4$. Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv \\boxed{3}\\pmod 5$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the pattern of the terms in the sequence $S$.

However, we are interested in finding the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$. \n\nWe know that $s_1 = 7$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$, and $7^2 = 49$ leaves a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. We can observe that for every even power of $7$, the remainder when divided by $5$ is $4$. Furthermore, for every odd power of $7$, the remainder when divided by $5$ is $2$.\n\nSince $100$ is even, $s_{100}$ will leave a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
