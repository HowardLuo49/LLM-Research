Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we first need to determine the range of clever integers that are divisible by 27.\n\nSince the sum of the digits of a number divisible by 27 must also be divisible by 27, we look for numbers with a digit sum of 9 that are divisible by 27. The only numbers that fit this criteria in the range are 99 and 108.\n\nTherefore, there are two clever integers that are divisible by 27 out of a total of 49 clever integers (120-20)/2.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\frac{2}{49}$.",
