Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27, first we need to find all the clever integers that satisfy the given conditions. \n\nAny clever integer can be written in the form $10a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the digits of the integer. Since the integer is even, $b$ must be an even digit. And since the sum of the digits is 9, we have $a + b = 9$.\n\nGiven that the integer is greater than 20 and less than 120, we can write the possible values of $a$ and $b$ as follows:\n- When $a = 1$, $b = 8$\n- When $a = 2$, $b = 7$\n- When $a = 3$, $b = 6$\n- When $a = 4$, $b = 5$\n- When $a = 5$, $b = 4$\n- When $a = 6$, $b = 3$\n- When $a = 7$, $b = 2$\n- When $a = 8$, $b = 1$\n\nSo, the clever integers that satisfy the conditions are 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, and 91.\n\nTo find the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to check which of these integers are also divisible by 27. The only integer that satisfies this condition is 55.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of all clever integers that is divisible by 27 is $\\frac{1}{8}$.",
