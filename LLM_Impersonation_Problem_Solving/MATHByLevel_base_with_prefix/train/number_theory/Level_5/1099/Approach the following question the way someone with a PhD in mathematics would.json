    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $4,1,6$, and $9$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((3x+4)(7x+1)(13x+6)(2x+9),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 9, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(216,x)\n\\end{align*}Since $15336$ is a multiple of $216$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{216}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $f(x)$ and $x$, we first need to factorize each of the expressions.\n\nWe know that $x$ is a multiple of $15336$, so we can write $x = 15336k$ for some integer $k$. \n\nNow, let's express $f(x)$ in terms of $k$:\n$f(x) = (3(15336k) + 4)(7(15336k) + 1)(13(15336k) + 6)(2(15336k) + 9)$\n$f(x) = (46008k + 4)(107352k + 1)(199368k + 6)(30672k + 9)$\n$f(x) = 46008k + 4)(107352k + 1)(199368k + 6)(30672k + 9)$\n\nSince every term in $f(x)$ includes a factor of $x$, the GCD of $f(x)$ and $x$ must also be a multiple of $x$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $x = 15336k$.",
