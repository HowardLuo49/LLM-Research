    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "For the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ to terminate, the denominator must be of the form $5^k$ for some non-negative integer $k$. Since $475 = 5^2 \\cdot 19$, the only possible values of $n$ for which the decimal representation terminates are those that are divisible by 19.\n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{474}{19} \\right\\rfloor = 24$ integers between 1 and 474 that are divisible by 19. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{24}$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates.",
