    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive yield a terminating decimal representation for $\\frac{n}{475}$, we must first rewrite $\\frac{n}{475}$ in its simplest form. \n\nWe can see that $475 = 5^2 \\cdot 19$, which means that the only prime factors in the denominator are 5 and 19. Thus, the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ will terminate if and only if $n$ is divisible by $5$ and/or $19$ (or in other words, if all prime factors of the denominator divide $n$).\n\nGiven that we are looking at integers between 1 and 474 inclusive, we need to determine how many integers in this range are divisible by either 5, 19, or both. We can easily count the number of integers divisible by 5, which is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{474}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 94$.\n\nSimilarly, the number of integers divisible by 19 in this range is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{474}{19} \\right\\rfloor = 24$.\n\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that the integers divisible by both 5 and 19 will be counted twice in the sum. To find these integers, we can calculate the number of integers divisible by $5 \\cdot 19 = 95$ within the range of 1 to 474, which is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{474}{95} \\right\\rfloor = 4$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of integers $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive that yield a terminating decimal representation for $\\frac{n}{475}$ is the sum of the integers divisible by 5, divisible by 19, minus the integers divisible by both 5 and 19. This yields $94 + 24 - 4 = 114$. \n\nHence, there are 114 integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates.",
