    "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many perfect squares less than $10^6$ are multiples of 24. \n\nThe prime factorization of 24 is $2^3 \\times 3$. For a perfect square to be a multiple of 24, the exponents of all primes in its prime factorization must be even. \n\nSo, the perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 must have even exponents for both 2 and 3 in their prime factorizations. \n\nFor 2, we need the exponent to be a multiple of 2. Since there are $10^6 / (2^2) = 250000$ perfect squares less than $10^6$ that have an exponent of 2, we need to count how many of these are also multiples of 3. \n\nFor 3, we also need the exponent to be a multiple of 2. Since there are $10^6 / (2^2 \\times 3^2) = 83333$ perfect squares less than $10^6$ that have an exponent of 2 for both 2 and 3 in their prime factorizations. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24 is 83333.",
