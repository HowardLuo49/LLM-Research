    "solution": "Rewrite the expression as\\[4(5x + 1)(5x + 3)(5x+5)\\]Since $x$ is odd, let $x = 2n-1$. The expression becomes\\[4(10n-4)(10n-2)(10n)=32(5n-2)(5n-1)(5n)\\]Consider just the product of the last three terms, $5n-2,5n-1,5n$, which are consecutive. At least one term must be divisible by $2$ and one term must be divisible by $3$ then. Also, since there is the $5n$ term, the expression must be divisible by $5$. Therefore, the minimum integer that always divides the expression must be $32 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{960}$.\nTo prove that the number is the largest integer to work, consider when $x=1$ and $x = 5$. These respectively evaluate to be $1920,\\ 87360$; their greatest common factor is indeed $960$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x=2n+1$, where $n$ is an integer. Then the given expression can be rewritten as\n\\[(20n+12)(20n+16)(10n+5)=2^2(5n+3)2^2(5n+4)5(2n+1)=(25)(4)(5)(2n+1)(5n+3)(5n+4).\\]\n\nConsider the factors $5n+3$ and $5n+4$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $n \\geq 0$ (the case $n<0$ can be handled similarly). Then we can observe that $5n+4 > 5n+3$. \n\nNow, in order to find the largest integer that always divides the expression, we need to find a common factor that will divide both $5n+3$ and $5n+4$ for all possible integers $n$. It is clear that the largest integer that will divide $5n+3$ and $5n+4$ for all integers $n$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer that always divides the expression \\[(10x+2)(10x+6)(5x+5)\\] when $x$ is an odd number is $\\boxed{100}$.",
