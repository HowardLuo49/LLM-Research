    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n",
    "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the number of members in the marching band as M. \n\nFrom the first condition, we know that M equals a square number plus 5, so we can express this as M = x^2 + 5, where x is a positive integer.\n\nFrom the second condition, we know that M can also be expressed as a rectangle with 7 more rows than columns, so we can express this as M = (y+7)y, where y is a positive integer.\n\nEquating the two expressions for M, we have x^2 + 5 = (y + 7)y.\n\nExpanding the right side, we get y^2 + 7y, so our equation becomes x^2 + 5 = y^2 + 7y. Rearranging terms, we get x^2 - y^2 = 7y - 5.\n\nFactoring the left side as (x+y)(x-y), and noting that y cannot be equal to x as the marching band cannot have a square formation and a rectangular formation at the same time, we can express the equation as (x+y)(x-y) = 7y - 5.\n\nIt can be observed that the difference between any two consecutive perfect squares increases by 2 as the squares increase. We proceed to list some values of y and x to determine the maximum number of members in the marching band:\n\ny = 1, x = 4\ny = 2, x = 6\ny = 3, x = 11\ny = 4, x = 16\ny = 5, x = 26\ny = 6, x = 36\n\nWe can see that for y = 5 and x = 26, we get 26^2 + 5 = 676 + 5 = 681, which is the maximum number of members in the marching band that satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the maximum number of members in the marching band is 681.",
