    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(9,2a+9).\n\\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of $6a^2+49a+108$ and $2a+9$, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. We begin by dividing the polynomial $6a^2+49a+108$ by $2a+9$:\n\n$6a^2 + 49a + 108 = (3a+4)(2a+9) + 0$\n\nTherefore, the remainder is $0$. This means that $2a+9$ divides evenly into $6a^2+49a+108$.\n\nNow, we need to find the greatest common divisor of $2a+9$ and $6a^2+49a+108$. Since $2a+9$ divides evenly into $6a^2+49a+108$, the greatest common divisor must be $2a+9$.\n\nHence, the greatest common divisor of $6a^2+49a+108$ and $2a+9$ is $2a+9$.",
