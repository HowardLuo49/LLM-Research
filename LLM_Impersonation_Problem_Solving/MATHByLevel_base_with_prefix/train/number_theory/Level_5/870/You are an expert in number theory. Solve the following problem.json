    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, we can express $0.\\overline{ab}$ as the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, we know that $a$ ranges from 1 to 9 and $b$ ranges from 0 to 9, excluding the case where both $a$ and $b$ are 9 or both are 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of different denominators for the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$. Since 99 is a multiple of 9, we are only interested in the factors of 99 that are coprime with 10 (the base of our number system).\n\nThe prime factorization of 99 is $3^2 \\times 11$. Using the formula for counting coprime factors, we find that the number of coprime factors of 99 is $(3-1)(1)(11-1) = 2 \\times 1 \\times 10 = 20$.\n\nTherefore, there are 20 different denominators possible for the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question. Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 5?: First, we can express $0.\\overline{ab}$ as the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$.
