    "solution": "For a number $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ to be divisible by $11$, we need $(a+c)-(b+d)$ to be divisible by $11$. If the digits of $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ add up to $9$, then $(a+c)-(b+d)$ must be $0$, because $(a+c)-(b+d)$ cannot be as large as 11 or as small as $-11$ without having $a+c+b+d\\geq 11$.\n\nNow $(a+c)-(b+d)=0$ implies that $a+c=b+d$, which in turn implies that $a+c$ and $b+d$ have the same parity (that is, they are either both odd or both even). Therefore, $a+b+c+d = (a+c)+(b+d)$ is even and therefore cannot be equal to $9$. So there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible numbers.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the four-digit number as $abcd$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the digits. The condition that the digits add up to $9$ can be expressed as $a + b + c + d = 9$. \n\nTo determine the divisibility by $11$, we can use the alternating sum rule for divisibility by $11$. This rule states that the difference between the sum of the digits at the odd positions and the sum of the digits at the even positions (when starting counting from right to left) must be a multiple of $11$.\n\nIn our case, we have a four-digit number, so the alternating sum rule can be written as $(d - c + b - a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Rearranging, we get $d + b \\equiv c + a \\pmod{11}$.\n\nNow we consider the possibilities for the digits $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that $a + b + c + d = 9$. \n\nIf we consider the possible values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that their sum is $9$:\n- $(1, 1, 2, 5)$\n- $(1, 1, 3, 4)$\n- $(1, 2, 2, 4)$\n- $(2, 2, 2, 3)$\n\nFrom the possible combinations above, we find that only $(1, 1, 3, 4)$ satisfies the divisibility condition, as $1 + 1 \\equiv 3 + 4 \\pmod{11}$. Hence, there is only $1$ four-digit number that is divisible by $11$ and has digits summing up to $9$.\n\nIn conclusion, there is $1$ four-digit number whose digits add up to $9$ and are divisible by $11$.",
