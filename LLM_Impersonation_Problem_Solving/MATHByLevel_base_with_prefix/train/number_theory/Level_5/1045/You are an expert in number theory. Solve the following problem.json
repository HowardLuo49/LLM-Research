    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least whole number that is divisible by 7 but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these integers.\n\nThe LCM of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60. This means that any number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any of these integers must be of the form 60k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nNow we need to find the smallest number of the form 60k + 1 that is divisible by 7. Trying out different values of k, we find that when k = 3, 60k + 1 = 181 is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the least whole number that is divisible by 7 but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6 is 181.",
