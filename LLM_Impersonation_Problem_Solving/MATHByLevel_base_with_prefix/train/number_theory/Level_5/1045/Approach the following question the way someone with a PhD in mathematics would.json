    "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least whole number that satisfies the given conditions, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We want a number x that is congruent to 1 modulo 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and is congruent to 0 modulo 7.\n\nUsing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can set up a system of congruences:\n\nx \u2261 1 (mod 2)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 4)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 5)\nx \u2261 1 (mod 6)\nx \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n\nThen, the least whole number that satisfies all these conditions can be found by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the moduli given:\n\nLCM(2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60\n\nTherefore, we can express x as:\n\nx \u2261 1 (mod 60)\n\nAdditionally, x must be divisible by 7:\n\nx \u2261 0 (mod 7)\n\nCombining these two conditions, we find that x \u2261 1 (mod 60) and x \u2261 0 (mod 7) implies x \u2261 301 (mod 420).\n\nTherefore, the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer from 2 to 6 is 301.",
