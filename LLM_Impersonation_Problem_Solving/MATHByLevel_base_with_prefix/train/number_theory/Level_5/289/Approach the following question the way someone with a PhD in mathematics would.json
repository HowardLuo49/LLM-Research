    "solution": "Since $21 \\cdot 3 = 63 = 2 \\cdot 31 + 1$, it follows that $21$ is the modular inverse of $3$, modulo $31$. Thus, $2^n \\equiv 2^{21} \\pmod{31}$. After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$, so $2^{21} \\equiv 2 \\cdot \\left(2^{5}\\right)^{4} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}$. Thus, $\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{31}$, and $$\\left(2^{21}\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 8 - 2 \\equiv \\boxed{6} \\pmod{31}$$Notice that this problem implies that $\\left(a^{3^{-1}}\\right)^3 \\not\\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems).",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we start by examining the congruence $3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$. This can be rewritten as $3n = 31k + 1$, where $k$ is an integer. We then want to solve for $n$ in terms of $k$. Dividing by 3, we get $n = \\frac{31k+1}{3} = 10k + \\frac{1}{3}$. Since $n$ is an integer, $10k$ must be an integer, so $\\frac{1}{3}$ must also be an integer. This implies $3$ divides $1$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution for $n$ satisfying $3n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$.\n\nNow we proceed to finding $\\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\pmod{31}$ without using the value of $n$. Taking $(2^n)^3$ modulo 31, we can use Euler's theorem which states that if $a$ is coprime to $m$, then $a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$. Here, since $31$ is a prime, $\\phi(31) = 30$. Thus, $2^{30} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{31}$. Consequently, we have:\n$$(2^n)^3 \\equiv 2^{3n} \\equiv 2^{31k + 1} \\equiv 2 \\cdot 2^{31k} \\equiv 2 \\cdot (2^{30})^k \\equiv 2 \\cdot 1^k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{31}.$$\n\nFinally, we have $\\left(2^n\\right)^3 - 2 \\equiv 2 - 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{31}$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$.",
