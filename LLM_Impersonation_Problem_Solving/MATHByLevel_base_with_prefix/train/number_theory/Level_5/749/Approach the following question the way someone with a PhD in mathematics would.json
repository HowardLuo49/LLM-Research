    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. \"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?",
    "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)",
    "gpt_response": "To find the points that satisfy both congruences, we first need to find the points that satisfy each congruence individually. \n\nFor the congruence $y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$, we can rewrite it as $y\\equiv -11x+2\\pmod{16}$ which is equivalent to $y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$. \nThe points that satisfy this congruence are those where $y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$. By substituting $y = 5x+2$ into the equation, we get $5x+2 \\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$. This congruence holds for all $x$.\n\nSimilarly, for the congruence $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$, we can rewrite it as $y\\equiv -5x+12\\pmod{16}$ which is equivalent to $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. \nThe points that satisfy this congruence are those where $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$.

This congruence holds for all $x$.\n\nSince both congruences hold for all $x$, the points they have in common are all points on the graph modulo $16$ graph paper. \nThe $x$-coordinate of these common points is simply all possible values of $x$, which range from $0$ to $15$ inclusive. \nTherefore, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of these points is $0 + 1 + 2 + \\ldots + 15 = \\frac{15\\cdot16}{2} = 120$. \n\nThus, the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the common points is $120$.",
