For a nonnegative integer $n$, let $r_9(n)$ stand for the remainder left when $n$ is divided by $9.$ For example, $r_9(25)=7.$\n\nWhat is the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ entry in an ordered list of all nonnegative integers $n$ that satisfy $$r_9(5n)\\le 4~?$$(Note that the first entry in this list is $0$.)",
    "solution": "The condition $r_9(5n)\\le 4$ can also be stated as $``5n\\equiv 0,1,2,3,\\text{ or }4\\pmod 9.\"$'\n\nWe can then restate that condition again by multiplying both sides by $2:$ $$10n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$This step is reversible (since $2$ has an inverse modulo $9$). Thus, it neither creates nor removes solutions. Moreover, the left side reduces to $n$ modulo $9,$ giving us the precise solution set $$n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$We wish to determine the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ nonnegative integer in this solution set. The first few solutions follow this pattern: $$\\begin{array}{c c c c c}\n0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\\n9 & 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 \\\\\n18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 \\\\\n27 & 29 & 31 & 33 & 35 \\\\\n36 & 38 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}$$The $22^{\\text{nd}}$ solution is $\\boxed{38}.$",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we first note that the remainders when $n$ is divided by $9$ cycle every $9$ numbers. Since $r_9(5n) = r_9(5(n+9))$ for any integer $n$, we can see that the remainders when $5n$ is divided by $9$ also cycle every $9$ numbers.\n\nSince $r_9(5n) \\leq 4$, we are looking for the integers $n$ such that the remainder when $5n$ is divided by $9$ is $0, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4.$ These correspond to the values of $n$ where $5n$ is congruent to $0, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4$ modulo $9.$ In other words, we are looking for the numbers $n$ such that $$5n \\equiv 0, 1, 2, 3, \\text{ or } 4 \\pmod{9}$$\n\nBy examining the possible remainders when $5n$ is divided by $9$, we can write down the first $9$ possible remainders:\n\n$5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 0$\n\nTherefore, the ordered list of all nonnegative integers that satisfy $r_9(5n) \\leq 4$ would be the sequence formed by repeatedly cycling through the above list.
