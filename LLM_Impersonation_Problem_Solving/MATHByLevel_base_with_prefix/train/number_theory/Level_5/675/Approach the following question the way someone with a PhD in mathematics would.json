    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ given that $a+b=1001$, we can approach this problem by using the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nLet $d = \\gcd(a,b)$, then we have $a = dm$ and $b = dn$ for some integers $m$ and $n$. Since $a+b = 1001$, we have $dm + dn = 1001$, which simplifies to $d(m+n) = 1001$. Thus, $d$ must be a factor of 1001. \n\nTo find the largest such factor, we observe that 1001 can be factored as $1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$. Since we are looking for the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$, we should set $d$ to be the largest prime factor of 1001, which is 13. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{13}$.",
