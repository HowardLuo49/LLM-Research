    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?",
    "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number that is divisible by 9 and contains two even and two odd digits, let us first consider the properties of a number being divisible by 9.\n\nA number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9. Since we are looking for a four-digit number, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\nLet the four-digit number be represented as ABCD, where A, B, C, and D are the digits of the number.\n\nWe are given that the number has two even and two odd digits. Since even numbers are divisible by 2 and odd numbers are not, the sum of the even digits must be a multiple of 2 (and the sum of the odd digits must not be a multiple of 2).\n\nSince the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9, the sum of the even digits must be congruent to the sum of the odd digits modulo 9.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations of two even and two odd digits:\n- Even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- Odd: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n\nPossible combinations:\n1. Even: 0, 2 and Odd: 1, 3. Sum of even digits = 2. Sum of odd digits = 4. Not possible.\n2. Even: 0, 2 and Odd: 1, 5. Sum of even digits = 2. Sum of odd digits = 6. Not possible.\n3. Even: 0, 2 and Odd: 1, 7. Sum of even digits = 2. Sum of odd digits = 8. Possible.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 that has two even and two odd digits is 2017.",
