What is the sum of the possible values of $a?$\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 8\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 16\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 17\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 18$\n",
    "solution": "By Vieta's Formula, $a$ is the sum of the integral zeros of the function, and so $a$ is integral.\nBecause the zeros are integral, the discriminant of the function, $a^2 - 8a$, is a perfect square, say $k^2$. Then adding 16 to both sides and completing the square yields\\[(a - 4)^2 = k^2 + 16.\\]Therefore $(a-4)^2 - k^2 = 16$ and\\[((a-4) - k)((a-4) + k) = 16.\\]Let $(a-4) - k = u$ and $(a-4) + k = v$; then, $a-4 = \\dfrac{u+v}{2}$ and so $a = \\dfrac{u+v}{2} + 4$. Listing all possible $(u, v)$ pairs (not counting transpositions because this does not affect ($u + v$), $(2, 8), (4, 4), (-2, -8), (-4, -4)$, yields $a = 9, 8, -1, 0$. These $a$ sum to $16$, so our answer is $\\boxed{16}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the zeroes of the function $f(x)=x^2-ax+2a$, we need to find the values of $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find:\n\\[x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}\\]\n\nFor $x$ to be an integer, the discriminant $a^2-8a$ must be a perfect square. Thus, $a^2-8a=k^2$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we get:\n\\[a^2-8a-k^2=0\\]\n\\[(a-4)^2=k^2+16\\]\n\nThis equation tells us that $k$ must be a multiple of $4$ in order to have integer solutions for $a$. This is because perfect squares that differ by $16$ are always $4$ units apart. Therefore, $k=4m$ for some integer $m$. \nSubstituting $k=4m$ back gives $(a-4)^2=16m^2+16$, or equivalently:\n\\[(a-4)^2=16(m^2+1)\\]\n\nThe right side must be a perfect square, so $m^2+1$ must be a square. The only possible values for $m$ that makes $m^2+1$ a perfect square are $m=0$ and $m=3$, giving the possible values of $a$ as $4$ and $16$. \nTherefore, the sum of the possible values of $a$ is $4+16=\\boxed{20}$.",
