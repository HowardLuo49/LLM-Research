    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$, we need to find the largest four-digit integer that leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $23$. \n\nLet $n$ be the desired integer. We can express $n$ as $23k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Since we are looking for the largest four-digit integer, we can set $n = 9999$, i.e. $23k + 1 = 9999$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{9998}{23} \\approx 434.6957$. Since $k$ must be an integer, we take the largest integer less than or equal to $434.6957$, which is $434$.\n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $-9977$.",
