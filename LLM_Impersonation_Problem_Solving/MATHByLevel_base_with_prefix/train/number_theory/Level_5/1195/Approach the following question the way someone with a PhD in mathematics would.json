    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of $150,280$:\n\\begin{align*}\n150{,}280 &= 2^3\\cdot18{,}785 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot3757 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot289 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot17^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus the sum of the different prime factors of 150,280 is $2+5+13+17=\\boxed{37}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the sum of the different prime factors of a number, we first need to factorize the number into its prime factors. \n\nStarting with the number $150280$, we can first check if it is divisible by $2$. We see that $150280$ is even, so we can write $150280 = 2 \\cdot 75140$. \n\nNext, we check if $75140$ is divisible by $2$. Again, $75140$ is even, so we can write $75140 = 2 \\cdot 37570$.\n\nContinuing this process, we find that $37570 = 2 \\cdot 18785$, $18785 = 5 \\cdot 3757$, and finally $3757 = 7 \\cdot 537$.\n\nNow, $537$ is not divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$, but it is divisible by $3$ because the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. Therefore, $537 = 3 \\cdot 179$.\n\nSo, we have factorized $150280$ as $2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot3\\cdot179$.\n\nThe different prime factors are $2, 3, 5, 7, 179$.\n\nThe sum of these prime factors is $2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 179 = 196$.",
