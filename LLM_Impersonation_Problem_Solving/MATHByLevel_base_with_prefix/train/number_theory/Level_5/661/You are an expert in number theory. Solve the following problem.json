    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be the value of a pig and $g$ be the value of a goat.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n300 &= 210 \\cdot 1 + 90 \\\\\n210 &= 90 \\cdot 2 + 30 \\\\\n90 &= 30 \\cdot 3 + 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the GCD of $300$ and $210$ is $30$.\n\nSince $30$ divides both $300$ and $210$, any linear combination of $300$ and $210$ will also be divisible by $30$.
