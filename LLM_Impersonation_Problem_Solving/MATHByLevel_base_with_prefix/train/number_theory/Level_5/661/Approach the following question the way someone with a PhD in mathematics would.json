    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be the value of a pig in dollars and $g$ be the value of a goat in dollars.

Let the debt be represented by $x$. We can write the equation for this scenario as:\n\n$$300a + 210b = x$$\n\nwhere $a$ is the number of pigs used to pay the debt and $b$ is the number of goats received in change. We want to find the smallest positive value of $x$ that can be expressed in this form.\n\nTo find the smallest integer solution to this equation, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $300$ and $210$. \n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}(300, 210) &= \\text{gcd}(300, 210) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(90, 210) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(90, 30) \\\\\n&= 30\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is $30. \n\nIn conclusion, a debt of $\\$30$ can be paid in a way that satisfies the conditions given in the problem.",
