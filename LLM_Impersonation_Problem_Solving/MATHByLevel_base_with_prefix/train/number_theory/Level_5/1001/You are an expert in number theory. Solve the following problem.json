    "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a perfect square, we need to find the prime factors of $x$ and then determine the missing factors needed to complete each prime factor to an even power.\n\nPrime factorization of $x$:\n$x = 2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$\n\nTo make $x$ a perfect square, we need to complete each prime factor to an even power by adding the missing factors.
