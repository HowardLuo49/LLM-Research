    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Let $n$ represent the smallest integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n$\\frac n2$ is a perfect square.\n$\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube.\n$\\frac n5$ is a perfect fifth.\nHow many divisors does $n$ have that are not multiples of 10?\n",
    "solution": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$.",

In this case, $n = 30^3 \\cdot 25$ so it has $(3+1)(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 96$ divisors.\n\nTo find the number of divisors of $n$ that are not multiples of 10, we first consider the divisors that are multiples of 10. Since 10 is not a factor of 25, any multiple of 10 is formed by choosing 2 factors of 30 and one factor of 25.
