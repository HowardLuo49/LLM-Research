    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A $150\\times 324\\times 375$ rectangular solid is made by gluing together $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes. An internal diagonal of this solid passes through the interiors of how many of the $1\\times 1\\times 1$ cubes?\n",
    "solution": "Consider a point travelling across the internal diagonal, and let the internal diagonal have a length of $d$. The point enters a new unit cube in the $x,y,z$ dimensions at multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ respectively. We proceed by using PIE.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ dimension $150$ times, in the $y$ dimension $324$ times and in the $z$ dimension, $375$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions whenever a multiple of $\\frac{d}{150}$ equals a multiple of $\\frac{d}{324}$. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324)$ times. Similarly, a point enters a new cube in the $y,z$ dimensions $\\gcd(324, 375)$ times and a point enters a new cube in the $z,x$ dimensions $\\gcd(375, 150)$ times.\nThe point enters a new cube in the $x,y$ and $z$ dimensions whenever some multiples of $\\frac{d}{150}, \\frac{d}{324}, \\frac{d}{375}$ are equal. This occurs $\\gcd(150, 324, 375)$ times.\nThe total number of unit cubes entered is then $150+324+375-[\\gcd(150, 324)+\\gcd(324, 375)+\\gcd(375, 150))] + \\gcd(150, 324, 375) = \\boxed{768}$",
    "gpt_response": "To find the number of $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cubes that the internal diagonal passes through, we can consider the three dimensions separately. \n\nIn the x-direction (150 cubes), the diagonal passes through 149 faces of the cubes, because it intersects 150 corners (vertices) but not the first one.\n\nIn the y-direction (324 cubes), the diagonal passes through 323 faces of the cubes.\n\nIn the z-direction (375 cubes), the diagonal passes through 374 faces of the cubes.\n\nConsidering that the diagonal passes through 149 faces in the x-direction, 323 faces in the y-direction, and 374 faces in the z-direction, the total number of cubes it passes through is equal to the number of intersections in each dimension added together (149 + 323 + 374). This sums up to 846 cubes. \n\nTherefore, the internal diagonal of the rectangular solid passes through the interiors of 846 of the $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cubes.",
