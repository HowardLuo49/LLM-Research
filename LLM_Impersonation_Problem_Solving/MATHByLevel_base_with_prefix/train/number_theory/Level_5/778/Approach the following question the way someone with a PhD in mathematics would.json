    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(168,693) = 21$.  Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \\cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21.  Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \\cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21.  Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.\n\nIf we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",

Let $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ be the distinct prime factors of $a$, and $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ be their respective multiplicities in the prime factorization of $a$.
