    "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(168,693) = 21$.  Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168 = 8 \\cdot 21$, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by 21.  Since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693 = 21 \\cdot 33$, both $a$ and $c$ are divisible by 21.  Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c)$ must be at least 21.\n\nIf we take $a = 5544$ (which is $21 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 33$), $b = 168$, and $c = 693$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(5544,168) = 168$, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\gcd(5544,693) = 693$, and $\\gcd(b,c) = \\gcd(168,693) = 21$, which shows that the value of 21 is attainable.  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
    "gpt_response": "From the given information, we can deduce that $a = 168k$ and $b = 168m$ for some positive integers $k$ and $m$, and that $a = 693p$ and $c = 693q$ for some positive integers $p$ and $q$.\n\nThen, $b = 168m$ and $c = 693q$. Since $\\gcd(a,b) = 168$, we have $k = m = 1$. Similarly, since $\\gcd(a,c) = 693$, we have $p = q = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\gcd(168, 693) = 21$. \n\nThus, the smallest possible value of $\\gcd(b,c)$ is $\\boxed{21}$.",
