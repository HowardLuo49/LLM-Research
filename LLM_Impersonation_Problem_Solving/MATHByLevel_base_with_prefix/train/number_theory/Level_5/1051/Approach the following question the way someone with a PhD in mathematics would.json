    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. For how many positive integers $n\\geq 2$ is $1001_n$ a prime number?",
    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin solving this problem, we must first understand the notation $1001_n$. This notation represents the number $1\\cdot n^3 + 0\\cdot n^2 + 0\\cdot n + 1$ in base $n$. \n\nGiven that $1001_n$ is prime, we want to find the values of $n$ for which this number is prime. Let $p = 1\\cdot n^3 + 0\\cdot n^2 + 0\\cdot n + 1$ represent the number $1001_n$.\n\nIn order for $p$ to be prime, it must have exactly two distinct positive factors: 1 and $p$ itself. Since $p = n^3 + 1$, we can rewrite this as $p = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$.\n\nFor $p$ to be prime, one of the factors $(n+1)$ or $(n^2 - n + 1)$ must equal 1. Since $n \\geq 2$, we can see that the factor $(n+1)$ will always be greater than 1. Therefore, for $p$ to be prime, we need $(n^2 - n + 1) = 1$.\n\nSolving the equation $n^2 - n + 1 = 1$ gives $n^2 - n = 0$, which yields $n(n-1) = 0$.
