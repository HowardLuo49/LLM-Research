    "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "First, let's convert $1001_n$ into base 10 to make it easier to work with. \n\n$1001_n = 1\\cdot n^3 + 0\\cdot n^2 + 0\\cdot n + 1 = n^3 + 1$\n\nWe are looking for positive integers $n\\geq 2$ such that $n^3 + 1$ is a prime number. Let's start by noticing that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $n \\geq 2$, we know that $n^2 - n + 1 > 1$ and so $n+1$ must be equal to 1. So the only possible n is n = 1, which is not greater than or equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integers $n\\geq 2$ such that $1001_n$ is a prime number.",
