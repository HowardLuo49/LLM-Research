    "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the remainder upon dividing $a_{83}$ by $49$, we can use modular arithmetic and the properties of exponents. We want to find $a_{83} \\pmod{49}$, which can be rewritten as $(6^{83} + 8^{83}) \\pmod{49}$.\n\nFirst, we can consider the powers of $6$ and $8$ modulo $49$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $a^{48} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ for all $a$ relatively prime to $49$. Since $6$ and $8$ are relatively prime to $49$, we have $6^{48} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ and $8^{48} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$.\n\nNext, we can rewrite $83$ as a multiple of $48$ plus a remainder: $83 = 48 \\cdot 1 + 35$.

Since $6^{35}$ and $8^{35}$ are not easily calculable by hand, we can use repeated squaring or a computer algebra system to find them.\n\nFinally, we can add $6^{35} + 8^{35}$ modulo $49$ to obtain the remainder when dividing $a_{83}$ by $49$.",
