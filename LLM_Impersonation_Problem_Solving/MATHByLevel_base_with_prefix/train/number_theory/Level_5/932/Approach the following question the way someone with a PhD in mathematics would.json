    "solution": "Recall that, by definition,  $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ means that $531n-1067n$ is divisible by 24. In other words,  $$\\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \\frac{536n}{24}=\\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer. Since $67$ and $3$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of $3$, the smallest of which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$, we first note that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ is equivalent to $531n - 1067n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. Simplifying, we get $-536n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence, we can divide both sides of the congruence by the greatest common divisor of $-536$ and $24$. The greatest common divisor of $-536$ and $24$ is $8$. Therefore, we can simplify the congruence to $-67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nFinally, we find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $-67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Since $67 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, we have $-67n \\equiv -n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies $-67n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ is $n = 3$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ is $n = 3$.",
