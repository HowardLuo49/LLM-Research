    "solution": "Recall that, by definition,  $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ means that $531n-1067n$ is divisible by 24. In other words,  $$\\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \\frac{536n}{24}=\\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer. Since $67$ and $3$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of $3$, the smallest of which is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this equation, we can simplify both sides first:\n$531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$3n \\equiv 19n \\pmod{24}$\n\nNow, we can subtract 3n from both sides to get:\n$16n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$\n\nThis means that $n$ must be a multiple of $\\frac{24}{\\gcd(16, 24)} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3$. So, the smallest positive integer $n$ will be:\n$n = 3$ \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ is $n = 3$.",
    "solution_prompt": "The following is a response to a question.
