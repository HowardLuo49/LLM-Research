    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.",
    "solution": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this question, we need to consider the factors of $36$, as they represent the possible numbers of chairs in each row and column. Since there must be at least two chairs in every row and column, we need to exclude $1$ as a factor. \n\nThe factors of $36$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18,$ and $36.$ We need to exclude $1$ and $36$ from our consideration, as they do not meet the requirement of having at least two chairs in every row and column. This leaves us with the factors $2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12,$ and $18.$\n\nWe need to consider all the pairs of factors that will make up the rows and columns. For example, if we choose $2$ as the number of chairs in a row, then we must choose $18$ as the number of rows so that all $36$ chairs are accounted for. Similarly, if we choose $18$ as the number of chairs in a row, then $2$ must be the number of rows.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrays possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs is the number of valid pairs of factors. Considering all the possible combinations, we find that the number of arrays is $7,$ which corresponds to the pairs $(2,18), (3,12),$ and $(4,9),$ along with their reversals $(18,2), (12,3),$ and $(9,4),$ plus the scenario where both the number of rows and columns are the same, which is $(6,6).$\n\nTherefore, there are 7 possible arrays in a classroom containing 36 chairs.",
