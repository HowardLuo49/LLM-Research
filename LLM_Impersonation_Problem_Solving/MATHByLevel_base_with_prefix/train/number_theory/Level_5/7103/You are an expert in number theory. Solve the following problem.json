Which of the following must be a divisor of $a$?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 5} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 7} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 11} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 13} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 17}$\n",
    "solution": "The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$, both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$, both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$, and $54$ divides $d$. Note that we have the prime factorizations:\\begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\\cdot 3,\\\\ 36 &= 2^2\\cdot 3^2,\\\\ 54 &= 2\\cdot 3^3. \\end{align*}\nHence we have\\begin{align*} a &= 2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot w\\\\ b &= 2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot x\\\\ c &= 2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot y\\\\ d &= 2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot z \\end{align*}for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$. Now if $3$ divdes $w$, then $\\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$. Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$, then $\\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$. Therefore,\\[\\gcd(a,d)=2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\gcd(w,z)\\]where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\\gcd(w,z)$. In other words, $\\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$. The only possible value of $\\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\\cdot3\\cdot13$, so the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17. Since $\\gcd(b,c) = 36$ and $p$ divides $b$, $p$ must divide $c$. Similarly, $p$ must divide $d$. Since $\\gcd(c,d) = 54$, $p$ must divide $54$. However, $54$ is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, or 17. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 5}}$ must be a divisor of $a$.",
