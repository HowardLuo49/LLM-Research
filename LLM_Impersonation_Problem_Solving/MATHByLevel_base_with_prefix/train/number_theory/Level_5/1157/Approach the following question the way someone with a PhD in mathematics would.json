    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n^2$ is divisible by 18 and $n^3$ is divisible by 640?",
    "solution": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the given conditions, we must examine the prime factorization of 18 and 640.\n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $2 \\cdot 3^2$, and the prime factorization of 640 is $2^7 \\cdot 5$. \n\nFor $n^2$ to be divisible by 18, $n$ must have at least one factor of $2$ and two factors of $3$. For $n^3$ to be divisible by 640, $n$ must have at least seven factors of $2$ and one factor of $5$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer that satisfies both conditions is the least common multiple of the necessary factors of $n$. Therefore, $n$ must be $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = 2880$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n^2$ is divisible by 18 and $n^3$ is divisible by 640 is $2880$.",
