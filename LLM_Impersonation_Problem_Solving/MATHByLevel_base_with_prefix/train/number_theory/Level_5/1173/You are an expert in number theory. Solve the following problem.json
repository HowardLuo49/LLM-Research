    "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 11. In the next column, we see that $9_{a}+6_{a}=13_{a}$. This tells us that $a$ goes into 15 once, leaving a remainder of 3. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert the numbers in base $a$ to base 10 and then solve for $a$.\n\nLet's first convert the numbers $293_{a}$ and $468_{a}$ to base 10:\n\n$293_{a} = 2a^{2} + 9a + 3$\n\n$468_{a} = 4a^{2} + 6a + 8$\n\nNow, we can write the equation in base 10:\n\n$(2a^{2} + 9a + 3) + (4a^{2} + 6a + 8) = 7a^{1} + 3a^{0}B$\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n$6a^{2} + 15a + 11 = 7a + 33$\n\n$6a^{2} + 8a - 22 = 0$\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $a$ that satisfies this quadratic equation.
