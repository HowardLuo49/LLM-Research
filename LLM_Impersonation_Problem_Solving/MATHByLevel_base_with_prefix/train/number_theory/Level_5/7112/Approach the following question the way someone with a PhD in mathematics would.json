Let $N(k)$ be the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$. What is the maximum value of $N(k)$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 9\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$\n",
    "solution": "The number $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2} + 64 = 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k+2} + 2^6$.\nFor $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $I_k = 2^{k+2} \\left( 5^{k+2} + 2^{4-k} \\right)$. The first value in the parentheses is odd, the second one is even, hence their sum is odd and we have $N(k)=k+2\\leq 5$.\nFor $k>4$ we have $I_k=2^6 \\left( 5^{k+2}\\cdot 2^{k-4} + 1 \\right)$. For $k>4$ the value in the parentheses is odd, hence $N(k)=6$.\nThis leaves the case $k=4$. We have $I_4 = 2^6 \\left( 5^6 + 1 \\right)$. The value $5^6 + 1$ is obviously even. And as $5\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, we have $5^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, and therefore $5^6 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Hence the largest power of $2$ that divides $5^6+1$ is $2^1$, and this gives us the desired maximum of the function $N$: $N(4) = \\boxed{7}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the maximum value of $N(k)$, we need to determine the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$. We can express $I_k$ as $I_k = 10^{k+3} + 64 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^{k+3} + 2^6 = 2^6 \\cdot (5^{k+3} + 1)$. \n\nSince $N(k)$ is the number of factors of $2$ in the prime factorization of $I_k$, $N(k)$ is equal to the power of $2$ in the prime factorization of $(5^{k+3} + 1)$. \n\nBy the LTE lemma (Lifting The Exponent Lemma), we have $v_2\\left(5^{k+3} + 1\\right) = v_2\\left(5+1\\right) + v_2\\left(k+3\\right) = v_2\\left(k+3\\right) + 1$ for all odd integers $k$.\n\nTo maximize $N(k)$, we set $k + 3$ to be a power of $2$. The largest power of $2$ less than or equal to $1001$ is $2^9 = 512$. Hence, the maximum value of $N(k)$ is $9$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 9}$.",
