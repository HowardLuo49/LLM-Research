    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ terminates in decimal representation if and only if $b$ can be expressed as $2^m 5^n$ for some nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$. In this case, $b$ is $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nTherefore, the integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 such that $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates are those for which $n$ is divisible by $2^3$ and $5$. This means $n$ must be divisible by $8$ and $5$.\n\nThe multiples of $8$ between $1$ and $120$ inclusive are $8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120$. Out of these, only the multiples of $40$ are divisible by $5$. \n\nTherefore, the integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 such that $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates are $40, 80, 120$. \n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates.",
