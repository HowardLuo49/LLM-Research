    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}?$",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer n such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$, we can consider the equation $3n - 1356 = 22k$ for some integer k. This can be rewritten as $3n = 1356 + 22k$.\n\nSince we are looking for the smallest positive integer n, we can start by considering the remainders of 1356 modulo 3 and modulo 22. We have $1356 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and $1356 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$.\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as $3n = 1356 + 22k = 3 \\cdot 452 + 4 + 22k = 3(452 + k) + 4$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer n, we need to find the smallest positive integer k such that $452 + k$ is a multiple of 3. Since $452 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, we need $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer n satisfying the given congruence is $n = 3(452 + 1) = 1359$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 12?: To find the smallest positive integer n such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$, we can consider the equation $3n - 1356 = 22k$ for some integer k.
