    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$, we need to solve the congruence $3n \\equiv 18 \\pmod{22}$, since $1356 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{22}$.\n\nTo solve this congruence, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $22$. In other words, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $3x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$. Since $3$ and $22$ are relatively prime, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse.\n\nBy using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm or by inspection, we find that the modular multiplicative inverse of $3$ modulo $22$ is $15$, since $3 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 45 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{22}$.\n\nMultiplying both sides of $3n \\equiv 18 \\pmod{22}$ by $15$, we get:\n\n$n \\equiv 18 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 270 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{22}$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n \\equiv 1356 \\pmod{22}$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
