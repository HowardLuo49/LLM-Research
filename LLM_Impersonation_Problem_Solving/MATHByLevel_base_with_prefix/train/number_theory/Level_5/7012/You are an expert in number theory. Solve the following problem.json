    "solution": "If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is factorable:\n\\[(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10\\]\n$507$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 13^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three. $169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$. This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$. Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \\times 4 \\times 49 = \\boxed{588}$.",

Therefore, $y^2$ must divide $517 - 30x^2$.\n\nSince $517 - 30x^2$ has many factors, we will analyze each factor to find the possible values of $y$ and $x$.\n\nFactor 1: $1$\n$517 - 30x^2 = 1$ has no integer solutions for $x$.\n\nFactor 2: $11$\n$517 - 30x^2 = 11$ has no integer solutions for $x$.\n\nFactor 3: $173$\n$517 - 30x^2 = 173$ gives $x=2, y=\\pm 7$.\n\nThus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3\\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 7^2 = 3\\cdot 4 \\cdot 49 = 588$.",
