    "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of the given integers, we first express each integer as a product of its prime factors:\n\n$6^6 = 2^6 \\times 3^6$\n\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n\n$k = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n}$\n\nwhere $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$ are distinct prime factors of $k$ and $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ are their corresponding exponents.\n\nThe LCM of the integers will then have prime factors raised to the maximum of their exponents. Therefore, the LCM of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$ will have the prime factors $2, 3,$ and all the distinct primes in $k$ raised to the maximum of the exponents.\n\nWe need the LCM to be $12^{12} = 2^{12} \\times 3^{12}$. Thus, the prime factorization of $k$ must include all the prime factors of $12^{12}$ but raised to powers less than or equal to their respective powers in $12^{12}$.\n\nSince $12^{12} = 2^{12} \\times 3^{12}$, $k$ must also be of the form $2^p \\times 3^q$ where $0 \u2264 p \u2264 12$ and $0 \u2264 q \u2264 12$.\n\nTherefore, there are $(12 + 1) \\times (12 + 1) = 169$ possible values of $k$ for which $12^{12}$ is the LCM of $6^6, 8^8,$ and $k$.",
