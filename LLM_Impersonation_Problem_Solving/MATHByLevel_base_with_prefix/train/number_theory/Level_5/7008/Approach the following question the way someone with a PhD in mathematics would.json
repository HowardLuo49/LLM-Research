The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n",
    "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the 100th term of this sequence, we need to observe the pattern in the sequence. \n\nThe sequence starts with $1$ (which is $3^0$) and then follows with $3$ ($=3^1$). The next term is $4$ ($=3^0+3^1$), followed by $9$ ($=3^2$), $10$ ($=3^0+3^2$), $12$ ($=3^1+3^2$), $13$ ($=3^0+3^1+3^2$), and so on.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the sequence includes all non-negative integers that can be written as sums of distinct powers of $3$, with each power of $3 being used only once. \n\nTo find the 100th term, we can break down 100 into powers of 3. We have $100=81+9+9+1=3^4+3^2+3^2+3^0$. So, the 100th term would be $3^4+3^2+3^2+3^0=81+9+9+1=100$. \n\nTherefore, the 100th term of the sequence is $100$.",
