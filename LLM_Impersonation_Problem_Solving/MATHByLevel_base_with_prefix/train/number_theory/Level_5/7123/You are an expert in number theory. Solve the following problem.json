    "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We notice that this is a geometric series with first term $1$ and common ratio $7$. The sum of this geometric series can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\\frac{1(7^{2005}-1)}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$$\n\nWe want to find the remainder when this sum is divided by $1000$, so we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6} \\equiv N \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nBy Euler's theorem, $7^{400} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$. Therefore, we can reduce the exponent modulo $400$:\n\n$$7^{2005} \\equiv 7^{5} \\equiv 16807 \\equiv 807 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nNow we can substitute back into our original expression:\n\n$$\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{807-1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{806}{6} \\equiv 134 \\pmod{1000}$$\n\nTherefore, the remainder $N$ is $\\boxed{134}$.",
