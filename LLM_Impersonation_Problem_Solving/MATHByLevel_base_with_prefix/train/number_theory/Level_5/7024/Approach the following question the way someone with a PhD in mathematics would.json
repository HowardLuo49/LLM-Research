    "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $x$ and $x+1$ be two consecutive integers in the range $\\{1000,1001,1002,\\ldots,2000\\}$. We can express $x$ as $1000+a$ where $a \\in \\{0,1,2,...,1000\\}$. Then $x+1 = 1000+a+1 = 1001+a$. \n\nTo add $x$ and $x+1$ without carrying, we need the sum of the units digits of $x$ and $x+1$ to be less than 10, the sum of the tens digits to be less than 10, and the sum of the hundreds digits to be less than 10.\n\nThe units digit sum is $a + (a+1) = 2a+1$. This sum must be less than 10, so $2a+1 < 10$ implies $a < 4.5$. Therefore, $a$ can take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSince the tens digits of $x$ and $x+1$ are both 0, the sum is less than 10.\n\nFinally, the hundreds digit sum is also less than 10.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ pairs of consecutive integers in the given range for which no carrying is required when they are added.",
