    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Tom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
    "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that there are 288 students in total. Let $x$ be the number of students in each row. Since there must be at least 10 rows with at least 15 students in each row, we have the inequality $10x \\leq 288$ and $x \\geq 15$.\n\nSolving the inequality $10x \\leq 288$, we have $x \\leq 28.8$. Since $x$ must be an integer, the possible values for $x$ are 15, 16, 17, ..., 28. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is:\n\n$15 + 16 + 17 + ... + 28 = \\frac{28-15+1}{2} \\times ( 15 + 28) = 210$\n\nSo, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $\\boxed{210}$.",
