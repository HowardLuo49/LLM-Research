    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",

For example, the binary number 101 is a palindrome because when read backwards, it is still 101.\n\nIn base 4 (quaternary), a palindrome is a number that is the same when read forwards and backwards. For example, the quaternary number 121 is a palindrome because when read backwards, it is still 121.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we can start by checking some small numbers:\n\n6 in base 2 is 110, which is not a palindrome.\n6 in base 4 is 12, which is not a palindrome.\n7 in base 2 is 111, which is a palindrome.\n7 in base 4 is 13, which is not a palindrome.\n8 in base 2 is 1000, which is not a palindrome.\n8 in base 4 is 20, which is not a palindrome.\n9 in base 2 is 1001, which is a palindrome.\n9 in base 4 is 21, which is not a palindrome.\n10 in base 2 is 1010, which is not a palindrome.\n10 in base 4 is 22, which is not a palindrome.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the smallest positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 is 9.
