    "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we need to first understand what it means for a number to be a palindrome in different number bases. \n\nIn base-10, a palindrome number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 11, 121, 1331, etc. In base 2, a palindrome number is one whose binary representation reads the same forwards and backwards. In base 4, a palindrome number is one whose representation reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nTo find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we need to start by checking small numbers. \n\nIn base 2, the first few palindromic numbers greater than 5 are 11, 101, 111, 1001, 1111, etc. \n\nIn base 4, the first few palindromic numbers greater than 5 are 11, 22, 33, 44, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 202, etc. \n\nWe can see that the number 11 is the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is the number 11.",
