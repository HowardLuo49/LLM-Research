    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",

We can express $a$ and $b$ in terms of their prime factorization as $a=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ and $b=p_1^{b_1}p_2^{b_2}\\cdots p_k^{b_k}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ and $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_k$ are non-negative integers representing the exponents of the prime factors.\n\nThe LCM of $a$ and $b$ can be expressed as $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=p_1^{\\max(a_1,b_1)}p_2^{\\max(a_2,b_2)}\\cdots p_k^{\\max(a_k,b_k)}$, and the GCD of $a$ and $b$ can be expressed as $\\gcd(a,b)=p_1^{\\min(a_1,b_1)}p_2^{\\min(a_2,b_2)}\\cdots p_k^{\\min(a_k,b_k)}$.\n\nNow, let's apply these concepts to the given equation $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450$.

Substituting $b=2$ into the equation, we have:\n\n$$2^{\\max(a,2)}5^{2} = 2^{\\min(a,2)}5^{2}+450$$\n\nBecause the powers of $2$ and $5$ on both sides must be equal, we have $\\max(a,2)=\\min(a,2)$.
