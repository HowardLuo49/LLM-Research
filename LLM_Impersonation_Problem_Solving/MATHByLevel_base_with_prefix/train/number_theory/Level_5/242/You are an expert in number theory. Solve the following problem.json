    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
