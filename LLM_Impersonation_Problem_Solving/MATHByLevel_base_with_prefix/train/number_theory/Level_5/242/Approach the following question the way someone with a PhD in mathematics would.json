    "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To begin, we can rewrite the given congruence as $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, since $3(6x+1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$ can be simplified to $18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$, and therefore $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\n\nNow, we recognize that the congruence $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ has a solution if and only if $\\text{gcd}(18,p)$ divides $1$. In other words, if $\\text{gcd}(18,p) = 1$ or $p$ is a prime number not divisible by $2$ or $3$, then there exists a solution for $x$.\n\nTherefore, the prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ are those where $\\text{gcd}(18,p) \\neq 1$, which means the prime numbers $p$ must be either divisble by $2$ or $3$.\n\nThe sum of all prime numbers $p$ that satisfy this condition is then the sum of all prime numbers that are either $2$ or $3$, which are $2$ and $3$. Thus, the sum of all such prime numbers $p$ is $2 + 3 = 5$.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 5?: To begin, we can rewrite the given congruence as $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, since $3(6x+1) \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$ can be simplified to $18x + 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod p$, and therefore $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$.\n\nNow, we recognize that the congruence $18x \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ has a solution if and only if $\\text{gcd}(18,p)$ divides $1$.
