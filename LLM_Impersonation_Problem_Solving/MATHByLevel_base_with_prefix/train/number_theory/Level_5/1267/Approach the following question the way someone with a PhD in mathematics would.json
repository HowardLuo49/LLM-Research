    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. How many distinct, natural-number factors does $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ have?",
    "solution": "We prime factorize the given number as $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^4$. A factor of this number takes the form $2^a3^b5^c$ for integers $a$ between 0 and 8, $b$ between 0 and 2, and $c$ between 0 and 4. There are $9$ ways to choose $a$, 3 ways to choose $b$, and 5 ways to choose $c$. In total, there are $9\\cdot3\\cdot5 = \\boxed{135}$ factors.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine the number of distinct natural-number factors of a given integer, we must first express it in its prime factorization form. In this case, we have:\n\n$4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2 = (2^2)^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot (2\\cdot 3)^2 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 3^2$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of factors by adding the exponents of each prime factor and incrementing each exponent by 1, then multiplying the results. So, in this case, the total number of factors would be:\n\n$(6+1) \\cdot (4+1) \\cdot (2+1) = 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 = 105$\n\nTherefore, $4^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 6^2$ has 105 distinct, natural-number factors.",
