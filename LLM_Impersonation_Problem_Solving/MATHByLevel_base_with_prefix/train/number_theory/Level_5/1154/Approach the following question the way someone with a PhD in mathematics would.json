    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",
    "gpt_response": "To find the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7, we can utilize Fermat's Little Theorem. \n\nFermat's Little Theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$, $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. \n\nIn this case, 7 is a prime number and 9 is not divisible by 7. Therefore, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem to simplify the calculation of $9^{1995}$ modulo 7.\n\nSince $7$ is a prime number, we have $9^{7-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Therefore, $9^6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nNow, we can write $9^{1995} = 9^{6 \\cdot 332 + 3} = (9^{6})^{332} \\cdot 9^3 \\equiv 1^{332} \\cdot 9^3 \\equiv 9^3 \\pmod{7}$.\n\nCalculating $9^3 = 729$, which is equivalent to $1$ modulo 7.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7 is $1$.",
