    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the four-digit number as \\(N\\).\nThen, the eight-digit number formed by repeating \\(N\\) is \\(10000N + N = 10001N\\).\nTherefore, all eight-digit integers of this form are in the form of \\(10001N\\), where \\(N\\) is a positive four-digit integer.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form, we need to find the common factors of 10001 and all possible four-digit integers. Since 10001 is a prime number, the greatest common divisor of 10001 and any four-digit integer must be 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer is 1.",

Yes or no, is the final solution obtained in the following response 10001?: Let's denote the four-digit number as \\(N\\).\nThen, the eight-digit number formed by repeating \\(N\\) is \\(10000N + N = 10001N\\).\nTherefore, all eight-digit integers of this form are in the form of \\(10001N\\), where \\(N\\) is a positive four-digit integer.\n\nTo find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form, we need to find the common factors of 10001 and all possible four-digit integers.
