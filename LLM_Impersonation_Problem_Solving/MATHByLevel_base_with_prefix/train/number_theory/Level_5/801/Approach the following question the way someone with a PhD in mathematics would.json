    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. An eight-digit integer is formed by repeating a positive four-digit integer. For example, 25,632,563 or 60,786,078 are integers of this form. What is the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form?",
    "solution": "If the repeated four-digit integer is $n$, then the eight-digit integer is $10^4n+n=10001n$. So all numbers in this form share the factor 10001. Consider $10001\\cdot1000$ and $10001\\cdot1001$. After dividing out the factor 10001, 1000 and 1001 share no nontrivial factors, so the greatest common divisor must be exactly $\\boxed{10001}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of the form described, we can consider the structure of such integers. Let the four-digit integer be represented by abcd, where a, b, c, and d are the individual digits. Then the eight-digit integer formed by repeating abcd is given by abcdabcd.\n\nNow, notice that abcdabcd can be factored as abcd * 10000 + abcd. This can be further simplified to abcd * 10001. \n\nSince 10001 is a prime number, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form is simply abcd, the four-digit integer that is being repeated. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of all eight-digit integers of this form is any positive four-digit integer.",
