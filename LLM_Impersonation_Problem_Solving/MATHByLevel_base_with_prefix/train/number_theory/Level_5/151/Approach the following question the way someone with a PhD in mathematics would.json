School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)",
    "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the day of the year with reverse calendar notation, where January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, and so on. This means that September 4 is day 247. \n\nSince the fifth Monday occurs when there are five Mondays in a month, let's determine the day of the week for day 247. \n\n247 \u2261 7 (mod 7), so September 4 is equivalent to the same day of the week as day 7. Since 7 \u2261 0 (mod 7), September 4 is a Monday.\n\nThe first Marvelous Monday after school starts will be the first Monday after the first month with 5 Mondays. Since September has 5 Mondays, the first Marvelous Monday will be on October 30. \n\nTherefore, the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is October 30.",
