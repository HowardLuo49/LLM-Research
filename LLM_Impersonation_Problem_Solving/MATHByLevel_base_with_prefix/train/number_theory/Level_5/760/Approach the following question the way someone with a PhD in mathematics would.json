Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must first analyze the prime factorization of 15. We have:\n\n15 = 3 * 5\n\nFor a factorial $n!$ to be divisible by 15, we need to have both 3 and 5 as factors. The function $f(n)$ returns the smallest value of $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, for $f(n)$ to be greater than 15, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n$ has at least 3 factors of 3 and 1 factor of 5.\n\nWe can construct such an $n$ by combining the prime factors of 15: $3 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 135$. Therefore, the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is 135.",
