    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined, we need to find an integer $n$ that is relatively prime to $1050$. \n\nNote that $1050 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ to be defined, $n$ must be relatively prime to $1050$, which means $n$ cannot have a common factor with $1050$ other than $1$. Therefore, $n$ cannot be an even number, a multiple of $3$, or a multiple of $5$ or $7$.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than $1$ that satisfies all these conditions is $n = 11$. Since $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined. \n\nThus, the smallest integer $n$ such that $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined is $\\boxed{11}$.",
