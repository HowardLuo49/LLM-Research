    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine when $n^{-1}$ modulo 1050 is defined, we must find the smallest integer $n$ greater than 1 such that $n$ is relatively prime to 1050. In other words, we are looking for an integer $n$ such that $gcd(n,1050) = 1$.\n\nTo find the smallest such $n$, we can factorize 1050 into its prime factors. We have $1050 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. \n\nFor $n$ to be relatively prime to 1050, it cannot have any common factors with 1050 other than 1. Therefore, $n$ must not have 2, 3, 5, or 7 as factors.\n\nThe smallest integer greater than 1 that satisfies this condition is $11$, as $gcd(11, 1050) = 1$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ greater than 1 for which $n^{-1} \\pmod{1050}$ is defined is 11.",
