Call a positive integer $N$ a 7-10 double if the digits of the base-$7$ representation of $N$ form a base-$10$ number that is twice $N$. For example, $51$ is a 7-10 double because its base-$7$ representation is $102$. What is the largest 7-10 double?\n",
    "solution": "We let $N_7 = \\overline{a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0}_7$; we are given that\n\\[2(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_7 = (a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_0)_{10}\\](This is because the digits in $N$ ' s base 7 representation make a number with the same digits in base 10 when multiplied by 2)\nExpanding, we find that\n\\[2 \\cdot 7^n a_n + 2 \\cdot 7^{n-1} a_{n-1} + \\cdots + 2a_0 = 10^na_n + 10^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0\\]\nor re-arranging,\n\\[a_0 + 4a_1 = 2a_2 + 314a_3 + \\cdots + (10^n - 2 \\cdot 7^n)a_n\\]\nSince the $a_i$s are base-$7$ digits, it follows that $a_i < 7$, and the LHS is less than or equal to $30$. Hence our number can have at most $3$ digits in base-$7$. Letting $a_2 = 6$, we find that $630_7 = \\boxed{315}_{10}$ is our largest 7-10 double.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the largest 7-10 double, we can consider that the base-$7$ representation of a positive integer $N$ can be written as $\\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i7^i$, where each $a_i$ is a digit from $0$ to $6$ and $a_k$ is not equal to $0$.\n\nWe are looking for an $N$ such that $2N = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i7^i$. This can be rewritten as\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i7^{i+1} - \\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i7^i = 0$$\nwhich is equivalent to\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k} (7a_{i-1}-a_i)7^i = 0.$$\n\nThis expression indicates that for each digit $a_i$, the digit $7a_{i-1}-a_i$ must also be a digit in base-$7$. Since we are looking for the largest 7-10 double, we want to maximize the value of $N$, which means we need to maximize the value of each $a_i$.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible digit for $a_i$ in base-$7$ is $6$. This implies that the highest possible digit for $7a_{i-1} - a_i$ is $6$, which further implies that $7a_{i-1}$ should be equal to $6$ if $a_i$ is $0$ and $7$ if $a_i$ is $1$.\n\nContinuing this logic, we find that the highest digit for $a_0$ should be $1$ and all other digits should be $6$. Therefore, the largest 7-10 double is $1666666_7$, which is equal to $4133430_{10}$, making the largest 7-10 double $\\boxed{4133430}$.",
