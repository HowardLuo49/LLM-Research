    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "Let $p$ be a prime number such that $n!+1 < p < n!+n$. Since $p$ is greater than $n!$, it must be greater than $n$. So $p$ is not less than $n! + n$.\n\nLet's consider $n$ even. We know that $n!$ is divisible by $n$, $n-1$, $n-2$, ..., $1$. Therefore, $n!+1$ is not divisible by any of those numbers. Since $p$ is greater than $n!$ and less than $n!+n$, $p$ cannot be divisible by any number less than $n$ either. This means $p$ must be greater than $n$ and less than $n! + n$.\n\nSimilarly, for $n$ odd, $n!+1$ is not divisible by $n$ either, and we can conclude that $p$ must be greater than $n$ and less than $n! + n$.\n\nIn conclusion, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is $\\boxed{\\text{(B) } 1}$.",
