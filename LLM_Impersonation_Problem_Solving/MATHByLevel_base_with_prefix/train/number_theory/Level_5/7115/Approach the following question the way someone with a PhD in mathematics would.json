For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n",
    "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to understand the properties of prime numbers and factorials. \n\nFor any integer $n>1$, the number $n!$ is the product of all positive integers up to $n$. This means that $n!$ is divisible by all integers from 2 to $n$, inclusive. Therefore, $n! + 1$ is not divisible by any integer from 2 to $n$. \n\nNow, let's consider the range of numbers between $n! + 1$ and $n! + n$. Since $n! + 1$ is not divisible by any integer from 2 to $n$, all the numbers in this range have to be composite numbers. This means that there cannot be any prime numbers in this range, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) } 0}$.\n\nThus, a PhD in mathematics would analyze the problem by relying on the fundamental properties of factorials and prime numbers to arrive at the correct solution.",
