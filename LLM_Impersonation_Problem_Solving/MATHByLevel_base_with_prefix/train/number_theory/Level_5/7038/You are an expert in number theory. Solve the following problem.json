    "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let's denote the required number as N. \n\nSince N has 6 odd divisors and 12 even divisors, we can write N as N = p_1^2 * p_2^2 * p_3^2, where p_1, p_2, and p_3 are distinct odd primes. \n\nNow, the number of divisors of N can be calculated by multiplying the powers of the prime factors (plus one) together. So the total number of divisors of N will be (2+1) * (2+1) * (2+1) = 27. \n\nSince N has 27 divisors, it must be the case that p_1, p_2, and p_3 are the only prime factors of N. This means that N must be a perfect square. \n\nThe smallest perfect square with 27 divisors is obtained by setting p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5, and p_3 = 7. Therefore, N = 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 = 3150.\n\nThus, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is 3150.",
