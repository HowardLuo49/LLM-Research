    "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To find the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors, we must first understand the properties of odd and even divisors.\n\nAn integer with an odd number of divisors must be a perfect square since each divisor comes in pairs, except for the square root of the number which counts as a single divisor. Similarly, an integer with an even number of divisors must not be a perfect square.\n\nLet the required integer be denoted as N. Since N has six positive odd integer divisors, it must be a perfect square. Further, since it also has twelve positive even integer divisors, it must not be a perfect square.\n\nGiven these constraints, the smallest such integer N can be found by considering the prime factorization of N. We need to distribute the factors 2 and 3 (odd prime factors) among the powers of the prime factors such that N does not become a perfect square.\n\nTo achieve this, we can consider the following factorization: N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5. This results in N = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is 180.",
