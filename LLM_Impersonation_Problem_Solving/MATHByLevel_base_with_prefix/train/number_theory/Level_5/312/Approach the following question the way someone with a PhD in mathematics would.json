Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "gpt_response": "To approach this problem, we first need to find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square. The square numbers are usually written as n^2, where n is an integer. The prime factorization of 20 is 2*2*5. To be a square, the exponents of the prime factors must be even. So, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square is 20^2 = 400.\n\nNext, we need to find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube. The cube numbers are usually written as n^3, where n is an integer. The prime factorization of 20 is 2*2*5. To be a cube, the exponents of the prime factors must be divisible by 3. The smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube is 20^3 = 8000.\n\nNow, we need to find all the multiples of 20 that lie between 400 and 8000. Dividing 400 by 20 gives us 20 and dividing 8000 by 20 gives us 400. So, the list of multiples of 20 between 400 and 8000 includes 20, 40, 60, 80,..., 7980.\n\nTo find the total number of integers in Cameron's list, we need to calculate the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence 20, 40, 60, 80,..., 7980. The formula to find the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is n = (last term - first term)/common difference + 1. In this case, the first term is 20, the last term is 7980, and the common difference is 20. Plugging in these values, we get n = (7980-20)/20 + 1 = 398 + 1 = 399.\n\nTherefore, there are 399 integers in Cameron's list.",
