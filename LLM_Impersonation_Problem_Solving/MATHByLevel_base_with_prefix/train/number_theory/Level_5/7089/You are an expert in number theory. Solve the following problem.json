For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n",
    "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that the number of positive divisors of a number $n$ can be found by prime factorizing $n$ and adding 1 to each exponent, then multiplying the results. For example, if $n = p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}} \\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}$, then the number of divisors of $n$ is $(a_{1} + 1)(a_{2} + 1) \\cdots (a_{k} + 1)$.\n\nTo be $7$-nice, we need to find a number $a$ such that $a^{7}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. This means $a^{7} = p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}} \\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ where $(a_{1} + 1)(a_{2} + 1) \\cdots (a_{k} + 1) = N$. \n\nSimilarly, for a number to be $8$-nice, we need to find a number $a$ such that $a^{8}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. This means $a^{8} = p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}} \\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ where $(a_{1} + 1)(a_{2} + 1) \\cdots (a_{k} + 1) = N$.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to consider the positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice. We can count the numbers which are $7$-nice, $8$-nice, and subtract this count from the total numbers less than $1000$.\n\nTo find the numbers which are $7$-nice or $8$-nice, we can use the fact that $N$ is a multiple of $7$ for $7$-nice and $N$ is a multiple of $8$ for $8$-nice.
