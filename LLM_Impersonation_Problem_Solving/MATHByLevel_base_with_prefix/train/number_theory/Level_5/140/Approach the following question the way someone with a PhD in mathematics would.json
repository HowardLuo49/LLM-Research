    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Let us denote the base $b$ three-digit number as $abc_b$, where $a,b,c$ are distinct digits in the range $0$ to $b-1$. \n\nThe number of ways to choose the digits is $b \\cdot (b-1) \\cdot (b-2)$. This product must equal 100 in base 10, so we have the equation $b(b-1)(b-2) = 100$. \n\nExpanding and rearranging, we get $b^3 - 3b^2 + 2b - 100 = 0$. \n\nSince we are looking for a three-digit number, the base $b$ must be greater than 5. By testing values, we find that $b=8$ is a solution to the equation, as $8^3 - 3(8)^2 + 2(8) - 100 = 512 - 192 + 16 - 100 = 236 - 100 = 136 \\neq 0$, but $7^3 - 3(7)^2 + 2(7) - 100 = 343 - 147 + 14 - 100 = 196 - 100 = 96 \\neq 0$, so the only solution is $b=8$. \n\nTherefore, the base $b$ is 8.",
