    "solution": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements.",
    "gpt_response": "We know that for any integer $n$, the sum of all the positive divisors of $n$ can be calculated using the formula $f(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{p_i^{a_i+1} - 1}{p_i - 1}$, where $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ are the prime factors of $n$ and $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are their respective exponents.\n\nGiven that $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, we can rewrite that expression as $$1 + \\sqrt{i} + i = \\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{p_j^{b_j+1}-1}{p_j-1}$$ for some set of primes $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m$ and corresponding exponents $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$.\n\nSince $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ is a rational number, each factor $p_j^{b_j+1}-1$ must be divisible by $p_j - 1$. As a result, $p_j - 1$ must divide $p_j^{b_j+1}-1$. \n\nThis is possible only if $p_j - 1 = 1$, i.e. $p_j = 2$ (since $p_j$ must be a prime number). Thus, the factors in the product are all powers of 2, and since the product has to equal the sum, $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$, the set of powers of 2 must multiply up to $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. \n\nConsidering different powers of 2 one by one, we can see that $2^0$ is clearly not a divisor of $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$; $2^1$ divides $1$ which is not correct; $2^2 = 4$ would make the sum too large for most $i$, so we can safely conclude that $2^3 = 8$ is the largest power of 2 that divides $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Therefore, we need $8$ as a factor in the prime factorization of $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$.\n\nWe test values of $i$ for each possible set of exponents and see that $i = 49$ fulfills $f(49) = 8$, satisfying the conditions we require.\n\nHence, the only integer $i$ in the range $1 \\le i \\le 2010$ that satisfies the equation $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ is $i = 49$.",
