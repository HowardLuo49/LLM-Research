    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "Since Hal changes the batteries every 5 months, we can find the month in which he will change them the 25th time by calculating the remainder when 25 is divided by 12 (the number of months in a year).\n\n25 divided by 12 gives a remainder of 1. This means that after changing the batteries 24 times (12 months x 2 = 24 months), he will have changed them the 25th time in the month following May, which is **June**.",
