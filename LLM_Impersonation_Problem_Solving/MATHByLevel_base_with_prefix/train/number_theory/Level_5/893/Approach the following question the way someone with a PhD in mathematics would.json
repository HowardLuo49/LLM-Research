    "problem_prompt": "Approach the following question the way someone with a PhD in mathematics would. Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?",
    "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To determine in which month Hal will change the batteries in his calculator for the 25th time, we can use simple modular arithmetic. Since Hal changes the batteries every 5 months, we need to find the remainder when 25 is divided by 5. \n\n25 divided by 5 gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 0, which means the batteries will be changed for the 25th time in the same month as the first replacement. Since Hal first changed the batteries in May, the 25th replacement will also be in May. \n\nTherefore, the batteries will be changed for the 25th time in May.",
