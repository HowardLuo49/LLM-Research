Let $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n",
    "solution": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$.",
    "gpt_response": "To solve this problem, we must consider the possible values for each of the $a_i$'s. Since $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$, we can represent each $a_i$ as a pair $(b_i, c_i)$ where $b_i$ is the tens digit and $c_i$ is the units digit. Thus, $a_i = 10b_i + c_i$, where $0 \\le b_i,c_i \\le 9$.\n\nSubstitute $a_i = 10b_i + c_i$ into the expression for $2010$:\n$$2010 = (10b_3 + c_3) \\cdot 10^3 + (10b_2 + c_2) \\cdot 10^2 + (10b_1 + c_1) \\cdot 10 + (10b_0 + c_0)$$\nExpanding this out gives:\n$$2010 = 10000b_3 + 1000c_3 + 1000b_2 + 100c_2 + 100b_1 + 10c_1 + 10b_0 + c_0$$\n\nEquating coefficients of like powers of 10, we get the equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n1000b_3 &= 201\\\\\n100c_3 + 100b_2 &= 0\\\\\n10c_2 + 10b_1 &= 1\\\\\nc_1 + b_0 &= 0\\\\\n10b_3 + c_3 &= 2\\\\\n10b_2 + c_2 &= 0\\\\\n10b_1 + c_1 &= 1\\\\\n10b_0 + c_0 &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nBy solving this system of equations, we find that $b_0 = b_2 = c_2 = 0$, $b_1 = c_1 = 1$, and $b_3 = c_3 = 2$.
