    "problem_prompt": "You are an expert in number theory. Solve the following problem. Let $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n",
    "solution": "If we choose $a_3$ and $a_1$ such that $(10^3)(a_3) + (10)(a_1) \\leq 2010$ there is a unique choice of $a_2$ and $a_0$ that makes the equality hold. So $N$ is just the number of combinations of $a_3$ and $a_1$ we can pick. If $a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 1$ we can let $a_1$ be anything from $0$ to $99$. If $a_3 = 2$ then $a_1 = 0$ or $a_1 = 1$. Thus $N = 100 + 100 + 2 = \\boxed{202}$.",

Then, we want to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $10x_3 + 10x_2 + 10x_1 + x_0 = 2010$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of ways to distribute $2010$ identical objects (represented by stars) into $4$ distinct groups (corresponding to the place values) such that each group can receive any number of objects including $0$ (represented by bars). Using the stars and bars method, this is equivalent to $\\binom{2013}{3} = \\frac{2013 \\cdot 2012 \\cdot 2011}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 134343455$.\n\nTherefore, $N = \\boxed{134343455}$.",
